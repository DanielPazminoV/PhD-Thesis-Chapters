Fire weather variability and forecasting skill in Victoria, Australia

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 4 presented seasonal composites of fire weather variables.
 These composites link climate to extreme bushfire occurrences in Victoria.
 This analysis reflects average—large-scale—climate patterns associated
 with bushfire activity.
 The composites showed anomalies with consistent features from spring—September-
October-November—to summer—December-January-February—.
 Overall, the anomalies are moderate to strong in Victoria and the Tropical
 Pacific Ocean.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this chapter is to complement the investigation of average spatial
 patterns.
 Chapter 5 investigates the long-term interannual variability of seasonal
 fire weather in Victoria.
 Fire weather was investigated using seasonal metrics of the McArthur Forest
 Fire Danger Index.
 This index quantifies bushfire danger using meteorological data.
 Additionally, this chapter proposes an alternative bushfire index: “Victorian
 Seasonal Bushfire Index” (VSBI).
 This index is build upon the anomalous areas found in chapter 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, this chapter explores the capability of the VSBI to forecast fire
 weather and activity.
 The investigation required four groups of data: bushfire activity records,
 climate variables, fire weather metrics and climate indices.
 Each group of data comprises several variables that were linearly correlated
 for spring, summer and from spring to summer.
 Using weather station data, the VSBI shows a strong forecasting skill and
 consistent climate-bushfire relationships.
 In the other hand, results using Twentieth Century reanalysis data for
 the Victorian region show its limitations to capture these relationships.

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire activity records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment analysed the same bushfire activity datasets used in the
 previous chapter.
 Additionally, the definitions of bushfire event remain the same.
 A bushfire event in Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water and
 Planning (DELWP) dataset refers to any event that burnt more than 10.000
 hectares.
 Risk Frontiers (RF) database defines a bushfire as the consolidation of
 several bushfire—newspaper—reports in Victoria.
 Using these definitions, both datasets are comparable as demonstrated in
 chapter 4.
 The period of validated bushfire records data is 1961-2010.
 December-January-February (DJF) is the selected bushfire season in this
 investigation, since extreme bushfire occurrences are scarce in other months.
 For example, the DELWP database regitered 31 events during the DJF season
 over the period 1961-2011.
 The other three seasons of the year registered only 11 events during the
 same period.
 The investigation before this period requires alternative variables such
 as fire weather metrics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantification of fire weather required the computation of the McArthur
 Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the VSBI in Victoria.
 The FFDI provides daily values of bushfire danger based on meterological
 data.
 However, this research used a seasonal perspective approach.
 Thus, it was necessary to compute seasonal metrics of fire weather based
 on the FFDI.
 There are two common seasonal metrics of this index.
 The first metric is a cumulative sum of daily FFDI values (FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cum
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The second metric is the number of days with FFDI values greater than an
 arbitrary threshold.
 For this investigation the chosen threshold was 25 (FFDI>25).
 Values above this threshold reflect days with very high to catastrophic
 bushfire danger.
 The data used for the analyses were seasonal values (SON and DJF) of FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cum
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and FFDI>25 in Victoria.
 The FFDI computation comprised the period 1920-2010.
 The calculation required finding the date with the higher precipitation
 to set the soil moisture deficit to zero.
 This factor is part of the KBDI calculation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the VSBI requires normalized climate data averaged—summed
 in the case of precipitation—for each variable.
 A time series of VSBI values was a third input of fire weather in the analyses.
 The methodology section presents a detailed descripion of the VSBI formulation.
 The analyses used climate data to compute seasonal fire weather indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computation of fire weather indices required daily values of climate
 variables.
 The calculations with weather station (WS) data used 3 pm records.
 This is the approximate time when the most severe fire weather conditions
 occur 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Six Victorian weather stations were selected for this analysis (see figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Location-of-weather-stations"

\end_inset

).
 These stations provide the best available information for the computation
 of this index 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Seasonal fire weather in Victoria was also estimated using reanalysis data.
 Using the 20CR and HADISST data allowed to extend the calculations to the
 first half of the 20

 century.
 The 20CR data selected was the ensemble mean at the 1000 hPa level.
 Climate data was also used to compute climate indices.

Climate indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This investigation also explored the influence of several climate modes
 of variability over bushfires in Victoria.
 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and
 Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are among the most important for this region
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Gong1999,Williams2001,Cai2009,Risbey2009b,Ho2011,Ummenhofer2011,White2013"

\end_inset

.
 Seasonal weather composites suggested a strong influence of ENSO over bushfire
 occurrences in Victoria.
 Thus, the analysis has a higher emphasis over this driver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis used three ENSO indices, and one index for the IOD and SAM
 respectively.
 The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NINO3.4 and NINO1+2.
 The Dipole Mode Index (DMI) and Antartic Oscillation (AAO) revealed the
 relationships with IOD and SAM respectively.
 The analysis used climate indices data from several institutions: Australian
 Bureau of Meteorology (SOI), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
 (NINO3.4, AAO), Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (DMI).
 The climatologies used in the calculation of these indices were were 1951-2000
 (NINO3.4.), 1958-2010 (DMI), and 1979-2000 (AAO).
 The NINO1+2 index was computed using the HADISST data.
 The climatology for this index was 1911-2011 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation of fire weather variability and forecasting skill in Victoria
 required four analyses: validation of bushfire activity data, computation
 of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, formulation of the Victorian
 Seasonal Bushfire Index, and calculation of linear correlations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation of bushfire activity data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the two bushfire datasets available—DELWP and RF—was necessary
 to confirm their consistency.
 Chapter 4 describes the details of this process.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The computation of the FFDI requires meteorological data reported on individual
 weather stations.
 The regional average of each FFDI variable was used to compute values for
 Victoria.
 On the other hand, averaging the gridded reanalysis data over Victoria
 yielded regional values for the computation of the index.
 The 20CR and WS data comprise daily values.
 However, this investigation aimed to analyse fire weather with a seasonal
 perspective.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis used two seasonal metrics of FFDI.
 The first metric was the seasonal sum of daily FFDI values.
 The second metric was the number of days in a season that an FFDI exceeds
 a value of 25.
 In both cases, the seasons considered were SON and DJF.
 Additionally, a comparison of reanalysis and weather station data revealed
 the need for bias correction.
 Probability density functions (PDFs) and seasonal time series allowed to
 make these comparisons between the two types of data.
 The discussion section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Seasonal-fire-weather-variability"

\end_inset

 further examines the biases found in the 20CR data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach used to bias-correct the reanalysis dataset was to apply linear
 scaling techniques.
 Maximum temperature and wind speed required additive and multiplicative
 linear scaling respectively.
 On the other hand, relative humidity is a calculated variable.
 Therefore, the best approach was to bias-correct the variables required
 for its computation.
 The required variables are maximum temperature and specific humidity.
 Specific humidity required additive linear scaling.
 The equations used to calculate relative humidity are:

\begin_layout Standard
The composites presented in Chapter 4 revealed the seasonal patterns of
 each VSBI variable.
 Temperature, relative humidity and precipitation presented intense anomalies
 over Victoria (33S-36S; 145E-150E).
 Additionally, the NINO1+2 (0-10S, 90W-80W) and NINO3.4 (5N-5S; 170W-120W)
 regions presented strong and also statistical significant anomalies (see
 figure

 Intial tests yielded similar results using any of the two

 This chapter will show the results using NINO1+2 region.
 These anomalies are a manifestation of regional and global climate dynamics
 linked to bushfire occurrences in Victoria.
 Therefore, the analysis tested these regions for the VSBI formulation.

.
 This was the main criteria for their selection The index also incorporates
 SST in the NINO1+2 region as another variable.
 The seasonal patterns showed in Chapter 4 reveled that this variable is
 an important predictor of bushfire activity in Victoria.
 The computation of the VSBI is the aggregation of sub-indices based on
 these variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in computing the VSBI was to use the anomalies from the selected
 regions to calculate spatial averages.
 Subsequently, these daily means were averaged for the seasons September-October
-November (SON) and DJF respectively.
 The climatologies used were 1900-2010 for the 20CR and 1911-2011 for HADISST
 data.
 The computation comprised the period 1920-2010.
 On the other hand, the daily values of the six weather stations were averaged
 to calculate regional anomalies.
 This procedure allowed to calculate the VSBI sub-indices using weather
 station data.
 The available period of WS data was 1974-2010.
 The time series generated were divided by their standard deviation to normalize
 them.
 Finally, the VSBI is represented in the following in equation

Calculation of linear correlations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation used linear correlations to analyse the relationship between
 bushfire activity records, seasonal fire weather metrics, climate variables
 and indices.
 The correlations were computed for spring (SON-SON), summer (DJF-DJF),
 and from spring to summer (SON-DJF).
 The analysis used bias-corrected reanalysis data for the periods 1974-2010,
 1961-2010, and 1920-2010.
 These periods comprise the years with available weather station, bushfire
 activity and FFDI data—computed with reanalysis data—respectively.
 The SAM index—AAO— was excluded from the analysis.
 The AAO did not show a significant correlation with most variables in a
 first analysis undertaken for the period 1980-2010 (see appendix).
 The figures highlight the statistically significant results at the 5% level.

 show the linear correlation coefficients of the analysed variables in spring
 (SON-SON).
 The results indicate that during spring the VSBI and FFDI seasonal metrics
 are correlated.
 The relationship is more consistent for the first period of analysis (1974-2010
).
 In this period, VSBI shows strong and statistically significant relationships
 with FFDI metrics.
 However, only the FFDIcum metric still shows this relationship further
 back in time—using reanalysis data—.
 Additionally, the correlations between the FFDI metrics also decrease over
 time.
 These correlations start strong, with r=0.9 and r=0.78, with WS and 20CR
 data respectively.
 However, they decrease to r=0.37 and r=0.36 for the second and third period
 respectively.
 Overall, VSBI and FFDIcum have a stronger correlation than VSBI and FFDI>25.

, the range of correlations is -0.84 to -0.97.
 Every result was statistically significant for these two metrics.
 In contrast, the FFDI>25 metric shows no statistically significant results
 for the last two periods.
 For the first period, the correlations are -0.81 and -0.73 with WS and 20CR
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Climate indices show a moderate relationship with fire weather metrics.
 On the other hand, the “El Niño” component of the index (SST1.2) has the
 least influence over the VSBI.
 The correlations between VSBI and SST1.2 are statistically significant for
 the three periods.
 They fluctuate from 0.51 to 0.62.
 On the other hand, the correlations with climate modes of variability and
 FFDI metrics show similar results for ENSO and IOD indices.
 However, the DMI presents slightly higher correlations.
 These correlations are moderate for the first period.
 Further back in time, they become weak and statistically not significant.

 present the linear correlation results for summer (DJF-DJF).
 During this season, the relationship between VSBI and FFDI metrics decreases
 in comparison to spring.
 For example, correlations with WS data in SON ranged from 0.78 to 0.92 for
 the first period 1973-2010.
 However, the correlations decrease to 0.65 and 0.69 using the same data during
 summer.
 Additionally, reanalysis data show inconsistencies.
 There are periods of weak correlations and not statistically significant
 results (1974-2010); while other periods show moderate and statistically
 significant results (1961-2010).
 However, the results agree with the results in spring showing a strong
 agreement between VSBI and FFDIcum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also disagreements to determine which fire weather metric correlates
 better with fire activity.
 For this season, weather station data show that FFDI metrics have a stronger
 correlation with fire activity than the VSBI.
 The correlations with FFDI metrics and fire activity are higher with Risk
 Frontiers database (r=0.74 and r=0.72 with FFDIcum and FFDI>25 respectively).
 Although, the correlation with Victorian Government's database is also
 high (r=0.64 with both metrics).
 In contrast, reanalysis data shows that the VSBI presents better correlations
 with fire activity for the two periods (1974-2010 and 1961-2010).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no agreement to establish which climate variable has the strongest
 influence during this season.
 WS data indicates that relative humidity is the main climate driver of
 fire weather and activity.
 The result is consistent in spring a summer.
 In contrast, reanalysis data shows temperature to have a greater influence
 in summer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Climate modes of variability have less influence over fire weather in summer.
 Additionally, correlations show to be weaker with fire activity than fire
 weather (as expected).
 “El Niño” indices are moderately correlated with fire weather.
 On the other hand, there is no correlation between fire weather and activity
 with the DMI.
 This lack of influence is also an expected result as the IOD's influence
 weakens after spring.

The VSBI forecasting skill show inconsistencies between weather station

 Using WS data, the VSBI shows significant skill to forecast fire weather.

 and FFDI>25 respectively.
 As expected, the correlations are weaker for fire activity.
 The results are 0.66 and 0.54 using Risk Frontiers (RF) and Victorian's Governmen
t (DELWP) databases respectively.
 On the other hand, with reanalysis data the VSBI has a greater skill to
 forecast fire activity.
 This inversed relationship also occurs for the period 1960-2010.
 For the last period, the VSBI only shows a statistically significant—although
 weak—relationship with FFDIcum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Climate variables forecasting skill also demonstrate disagreements between
 observations and reanalysis data.
 The WS data show that climate variables have a higher skill to forecast
 fire weather than activity.
 In contrast, reanalysis data indicate the opposite relationship.
 These inconsistencies occur in two periods (1973-2010 and 1960-2010).
 Although, the disagreements in the correlations are not quantitatively
 large.
 In spite of these disagreements, the results show a a moderate forecasting
 skill using the two types of data.
 The resutls also agree to indicate that relative humidity is the climate
 variable with the strongest forecasting skill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, weather station and reanalysis data agree to show that the VSBI
 has greater forecasting skill than individual climate indices.
 Moreover, the individual forecasting skill of climate indices is moderate
 in the first period, weakens in the second period and disappears for the
 longest period.
 For the first period, “El Niño” indices show greater predictive skill than
 the DMI.
 However, reanalysis data show inconsistencies.
 For example, for the first period, it shows a greater skill to forecast
 fire activity and no skill to forecast fire weather.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Original seasonal FFDI computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FFDI computed with WS data depict more extreme fire weather for Victoria
 than the calculation using the 20CR.
 This difference is likely to occur for several reasons.
 FFDI variables from renalysis data do not correspond exactly to surface
 values.
 Near-surface reanalysis data was available at the 1000 h-Pa level.
 Calculations using these data do not exactly represent surface level conditions.
 Additionally, the FFDI computed with weather station data use values at
 3 pm.
 Yet, reanalysis data for FFDI variables is available at 6-hourly intervals.
 These intervals limited the availability of data to 4 pm values.
 Moreover, there are intrinsic limitations in the reanalysis dataset already
 discussed in Chapter 2.
 The linear scaling techniques adjusted the biases without significantly
 altering the correlations.
 However, the fire weather variability could change if we use a different
 index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative index might show a different seasonal fire weather trend.
 Yet, the difference is unlikely to be significant.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 determined that the FFDI could be comparable to the Canadian Fire Weather
 Index (FWI).
 The study compared the two indices for Australian conditions.
 The FWI is an internationally recognized fire weather index 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "VanWagner1974,VanWagner2005,Dowdy2009a"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the FFDI can be representative of fire weather conditions in
 Victoria.
 Nevertheless, the use of only one realization of the 20CR leaves non-quantified
 uncertainties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 20CR reanalysis has 56 model realizations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Compo2011"

\end_inset

.
 Every realization represents an equally possible state of the atmosphere
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Compo2011"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, fire weather computed with a mean value realization has a degree
 of uncertainty.
 This uncertainty could be quantified.
 Thus, the bias-correction results are only valid for one possible state
 of the atmosphere.
 However, the seasonal fire weather computations show an increasing trend
 consistent with an atmosphere under a global warming process 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increasing trend in seasonal fire weather computations for Victoria
 agrees with the results of other investigations for southeastern Australia
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 In fact, climate change is extending the bushfire season in this region
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clarke2011"

\end_inset

.
 However, the available data bases showed that most bushfires occur during
 DJF.
 Therefore, in this investigation the fire season was defined as the season
 December-January-February.
 The results can change—although not significantly- if the bushfire season
 is extended (e.g.
 November-December-January-February-March—).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bias-correction of fire weather variables (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every fire weather variable showed a significant correlation between weather
 station and 20CR data.
 Temperature, relative humidity and wind speed presented a similar variability
 with differences in magnitude.
 The application of linear scaling techniques corrected the mean of these
 three variables.
 The results were satisfactory since the correlations did not significantly
 change—and in some cases even improved—.Additionally, the bias-correction
 of reanalysis data produced similar outcomes in magnitude.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although, the bias-correction process yielded satisfactory results, weather
 station data was not homogenized.
 This is a limitation that is particularly evident for wind speed.
 The seasonal values for this variable show an abrupt increase after the
 year 2000.
 The change in the technology to measure the variable might cause the inhomogene
ities.
 On the other hand, linear scaling techniques did not correct biases in
 precipitation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 20CR data does not accurately represents precipitation in Victoria.
 The linear scaling bias-correction techniques did not yield better results
 for this variable.
 Therefore, the FFDI computation did not use bias-corrected data for precipitati
on.
 However, the FFDI is less sensitive to changes in this variable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dowdy2009a"

\end_inset

.
 This weaker sensitivity might occur because the FFDI equation does not
 explicitly includes precipitation.
 This variable is part of the drought factor.
 This factor does not include precipitation explicitly either.
 The drought factor computation requires the calculation of moisture deficits.
 In this research, the use of the KBDI yields these deficits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bias-corrected seasonal FFDI computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the bias-correction, the magnitude of FFDI results is acceptable.
 However, the FFDI computed with reanalysis data slightly over-estimates
 seasonal fire weather.
 However, during most years, this over-estimation is not significant.
 Additionally, FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cum
\end_layout

\end_inset

 seems to be a better metric of seasonal fire weather than FFDI>25.
 The results with FFDIcum show a higher correlation between bushfire danger
 and activity.
 The result is consistent using weather station and alternative reanalysis
 data (see Chapter 6).
 This result is also similar using bias-corrected data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extended seasonal FFDI computation (1920-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is greater uncertainty in the accuracy of the results for the period
 1920-2010.
 Certain variables could present even larger biases before the period 1974-2010.
 The difference might be significant for variables like wind speed because
 of the incorporation of new technologies to measure this variable.
 Additionally, after the bias-correction the seasonal FFDI underestimates
 fire weather.
 This FFDI result is not consistent with the overestimation yielded for
 the period 1974-2010.
 There is no weather station data to compare the fields for the period 1920-1973.
 Therefore, an alternative approach could be the validation against an independe
nt reanalysis product like ERA-20C

\begin_layout Standard
In comparison to the time series of seasonal FFDI, the VSBI does not present
 any particular trend in the period 1961-2010.
 However, the VSBI time series shows that this fire weather metric is particular
ly sensitive to the sea surface temperature parameter.

The results show several inconsistencies between weather station and reanalysis
 data.
 Some of the most consistent results will be discussed in this chapter,
 while further discussion about the inconsistencies takes places in Chapter

 In this chapter, the analysis uses an alternative reanalysis dataset (ERA-20C).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather drivers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between variables in spring shows a significant influence
 of the IOD.
 These results agree with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 Positive IOD events drive hot and dry weather conditions during spring
 in Victoria.
 These environmental conditions dry fuel loads.
 Dried fuel loads makes the summer season more prone to bushfires.
 The IOD exerts a stronger influence than ENSO in this season.
 This result also agrees with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, there is a strong correlation between the DMI and ENSO indices.
 Therefore, the IOD might not be independent of ENSO as other studies suggest
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dommenget2002"

\end_inset

.
 In fact, ENSO indices show how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

El Niño
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 events also drive Victorian climate in spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the ENSO indices, NINO 3.4 showed the strongest relationships with
 climate variables.
 This strong correlation reflects how the oceanic component of ENSO influences
 fire weather.
 In the previous chapter, seasonal anomalies in this region showed statistically
 significant anomalies.
 These anomalies have a link with bushfire occurrences in Victoria.
 These patterns justified the decision to include the SST of this region
 in the VSBI formulation.
 In contrast, SAM does not have a significant influence on preconditioning
 bushfire seasons.
 The appendix shows the correlations for this variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strong influence of SAM over rainfall in Victoria is well known 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009b,Ho2011"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the lack of influence of SAM over fire weather is an unexpected
 result.
 The use of different climatologies could explain the weak influence of
 SAM (see appendix).
 The climatology used for bushfire variables was 1961-2011.
 On the other hand, the climatology for SAM was 1979-2000.
 Although the correlation results for climate indices vary from spring to
 summer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the correlations between climate indices and bushfire metrics in
 DJF are not strong.
 Thus, these findings contrast with the results in the previous season.
 The influence of ENSO and IOD is greater in spring than summer.
 These modes of variability have more influence building-up fuels loads
 in spring, rather than exacerbating bushfire danger in summer.
 However, ENSO and IOD do not show much skill to forecast fire weather on
 their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather predictability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative humidity and temperature in spring are strong predictors of bushfire
 metrics in summer.
 Moreover, relative humidity is the variable that most influences fire weather
 in Victoria.
 This result is consistent using weather station and alternative reanalysis
 data.
 Additionally, the correlations for relative humidity show similar results
 in the tests performed—correlations in SON, DJF and from SON to DJF—.
 This result agrees with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

 using vapor pressure as predictor.
 However, it is worth acknowledging again that weather stations data was
 not homogenized.
 Additionally, precipitation from reanalysis data was not bias-corrected.
 Finally, it is also important to contrast this result with the skill of
 the VSBI as an integrated index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the VSBI do not yield consistent results.
 Computations with WS data suggest that it could be useful to forecast fire
 weather and activity in Victoria.
 The results using these data yielded the expected relationships.
 Higher forecasting skill than local climate variables and climate indices
 on their own.
 Additionally, the VSBI presented a higher forecasting skill for fire weather
 than activity.
 The index also proved to yield similar results to FFDI seasonal metrics,
 with the advantage to be simple to compute.
 However, the use of the 20CR reanalysis in the computation of the index
 did not confirmed the results.
 It could be the case that this reanalysis data is not suitable for regional
 long-term analysis.
 Therefore, the next chapter uses an alternative reanalysis dataset to perform
 further tests to the index.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This investigation explored fire weather variability in Victoria.
 Seasonal metrics of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index quantified bushfire
 danger using meteorological data.
 This chapter also proposed an alternative index: the “Victorian Seasonal
 Bushfire Index” (VSBI).
 The VSBI aggregates normalized seasonal averages of bushfire weather variables.
 The computation of the two indices used weather station and bias-corrected
 reanalysis data.
 Linear scaling techniques were used to bias-correct these data.
 Additionally, the chapter explores the relationship between bushfire activity,
 fire weather, climate modes of variability and meteorological variables.
 The relationship was analysed computing linear correlations for several
 variables in spring, summer and from spring to summer.
 This analysis investigated fire weather and activity prediction skills.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seasonal fire weather variability shows an increasing trend during the
 period 1961-2010.
 This trend is consistent using weather station and reanalysis data.
 The trend is also consistent using different seasonal metrics of the FFDI.
 The 20CR data also shows an increasing trend in the first half of the 20th
 century.
 On the other hand, the alternative seasonal index shows to be comparable
 with the FFDI.
 Moreover, using weather station data, the index also shows fire weather
 and activity forecasting skill.
 However, the reanalysis data did not confirm these results.
 Observations and model data agree that relative humidity is the climate
 variable that has the greatest influence over fire weather and activity
 in Victoria.
 Additionally, climate modes of variability play a moderate role in driving
 fire weather in this region.
 ENSO and IOD are the most important drivers, and their influence is greater
 in spring than summer.
 However, these results require further examination using alternative reanalysis
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next chapter aims to test the sensitivity of Chapter's 4 and 5 results.
 The bushfire and heatwave weather patterns in Victoria are reproduced using
 an alternative fire activity database and heatwave definition.
 Additionally, the fire weather variability and forecasting skill are analysed
 using alternative reanalysis data.
