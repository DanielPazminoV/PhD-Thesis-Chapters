Seasonal bushfire weather variability and forecasting skill in Victoria,
 Australia

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal composites depicted an “El Niño-like” pattern associated with extreme
 bushfire seasons in Victoria.
 This pattern was consistent from spring to summer.
 This chapter describes how the weather in spring influence bushfire danger
 and activity in summer.
 Linear correlations established the relationship between several bushfire
 variables from these two seasons.
 The investigation required four groups of data for these correlations.
 The groups were: bushfire activity records, bushfire danger metrics, climate
 variables, and climate indices.
 Additionally, this chapter proposes a bushfire index: “Victorian Seasonal
 Bushfire Index” (VSBI).
 The VSBI is a simple index to analyze seasonal bushfire danger.
 The index uses bushfire weather variables and an ENSO index.
 The VSBI presents a moderate skill to forecast seasonal bushfire weather
 and activity.

\begin_layout Section
Data and methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment required four groups of data.
 The groups are: bushfire activity records, bushfire danger metrics, climate
 variables, and climate indices.
 The following sections describe the information available for each group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire activity records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment uses the same bushfire activity datasets used in the previous
 chapter.
 Additionally, the definitions of bushfire event remain the same.
 A bushfire event in DELWP's dataset refers to any event that burnt more
 than 10.000 hectares.
 Peril Aus database defines a bushfire event when it generates several reports.
 Using these definitions, both datasets are comparable as demonstrated in
 the previous chapter.
 Only the season DJF was since other seasons have scarce extreme bushfire
 occurrences.
 The period of analysis was 1961-2010.
 Consistent bushfire occurences data was available starting from this year.
 This allowed to perform the correlation analysis between the four groups
 of data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire danger metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantification of bushfire danger required the computation of FFDI and
 VSBI in Victoria.
 The FFDI provides daily values of bushfire danger.
 However, this research used a seasonal perspective approach.
 Thus, it was necessary to compute seasonal metrics of bushfire danger based
 on the FFDI.
 There are two common seasonal metrics of this index.
 The first metric is a cumulative sum of daily FFDI values (FFDIcum).
 The second metric is the number of days with FFDI values greater than an
 arbitrary threshold.
 For this investigation the chosen threshold was 25 (FFDI>25).
 Values above this threshold reflect days with very high to catastrophic
 bushfire danger.
 The data used for the correlation analysis was time series of FFDIcum and
 FFDI>25 in Victoria.
 On the other hand, the VSBI requires normalized climate data averaged—summed
 in the case of precipitation—for each variable.
 A time series of VSBI values was a third input of bushfire danger in the
 correlation analysis.
 The methodology section presents the descripion of the VSBI formulation.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment used climate data to compute seasonal bushfire danger.
 These indices use daily values of bushfire weather variables.
 The data used was the 3 pm records.
 This is the approximate time when the most sever fire weather conditions
 occur

 Seasonal bushfire danger in Victoria was also estimated using reanalysis
 data.
 Using the 20CR and HADISST data allowed to extend the calculations back
 to 1961.

.
 Seasonal weather composites suggested a strong influence of ENSO over bushfire
 occurrences in Victoria.
 Thus, the analysis will have a higher emphasis over this driver.
 The analysis used three ENSO indices.
 The SOI, NINO3.4 and NINO1+2.
 The DMI and AAO revealed the relationships with IOD and SAM respectively.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation of bushfire activity data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the two bushfire datasets available—DELWP and Peril Aus—was
 necessary to confirm their consistency.
 Chapter 4 describes the details of this process which is the same for the
 two experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Formulation of the Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI represents a simplified relationship between climate variables
 and an ENSO index.
 This relationship links large-scale with local climate processes that produce
 bushfire conditions.
 The VSBI assumes a linear relationship between three bushfire weather variables.
 These variables are temperature, relative humidity and precipitation.
 These variables dry fuel loads in spring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
 The effect these variables on preconditioning bushfire occurrences was
 the main criteria for their selection.
 The index also incorporates SST in the El NINO1+2 region as another variable.
 The index accounts for the effect of ENSO on bushfire conditions.
 The computation of the VSBI is the aggregation of sub-indices based on
 these variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The composites presented in Chapter 4 revealed the seasonal patterns of
 these variables.
 Temperature, relative humidity and precipitation presented intense anomalies
 over Victoria (33S-36S; 145E-150E).
 Additionally, the NINO1+2 region (0-10S, 90W-80W) presented strong and
 also statistical significant anomalies.
 These anomalies link regional and global climate patterns to bushfire occurrenc
es in Victoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in computing the VSBI is calculating spatial averages from
 the gridded anomalies from these regions are.
 Subsequently, these daily means were averaged for the seasons SON and DJF
 respectively.
 The period of analysis was period 1900-2010 for the 20CR and 1911-2011
 for HADISST data.
 On the other hand, the daily values of the six weather stations were averaged
 to calculate regional anomalies.
 This procedure allowed to calculate the VSBI sub-indices using weather
 station data.
 The available period of data was 1974-2010.
 The time series generated were divided by their standard deviation to normalize
 them.
 Finally, the VSBI was formulated in the following in equation

Calculation of seasonal bushfire danger 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation used the FFDI to explore seasonal bushfire danger in Victoria.
 The index is used in Australia by authorities to assess fire behaviour
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lucas2010"

\end_inset

.
 The FFDI yields daily values of bushfire danger.
 The index computation requires meteorological data reported on individual
 weather stations.
 The average of daily values for each weather station yielded regional values.

However, this investigation aimed to analyse bushfire danger with a seasonal
 perspective for Victoria.
 Therefore, the analysis used two seasonal metrics of FFDI.
 The first metric was the seasonal sum of daily FFDI values.
 Additionally, a second metric was the number of days in a season that an
 FFDI exceeds a value of 25.
 In both cases, the seasons considered were September-October-November (SON)
 and December-January-February (DJF).

A comparison of reanalysis and weather station data revealed the need for
 bias correction.
 Probability density functions (PDFs) and seasonal time series allowed to
 make these comparisons.
 The discussion section

further examines the biases found in the 20CR data.
 The approach used to bias-correct the reanalysis data was to apply linear
 scaling techniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For maximum temperature and wind speed required additive and multiplicative
 linear scaling respectively.
 Specific humidity required as well additive linear scaling.
 Relative humidity is a calculated variable.
 Therefore, the best approach was to bias-correct the variables required
 for its calculation.
 The required variables are maximum temperature and specific humidity.
 The equations required for its calcualtion are shown here:

A recalculation of relative humidity was also possible.
 This calculation used bias-corrected maximum temperature and specific humidity
 data.
 Precipitation was not bias-corrected.
 The bias-correction attempts for this variable were not successful.
 Additionally, the FFDI is less sensitive to precipitation changes

Linear correlations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter aims to establish the relationship between bushfire predictands
 and predictors.
 Moreover, the investigation explores how the relationship evolves from
 spring to summer in Victoria.
 The investigation used a linear correlation analysis to establish these
 relationships.
 There were four groups of data compiled or generated in this investigation.
 These groups are bushfire activity records, seasonal bushfire danger metrics,
 climate variables and indices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correlation analysis used data from spring (SON) and summer (DJF).
 The exception was for bushfire activity records.
 The bushfire definition used accounts for extreme events.
 These events are not common in other seasons than DJF.
 Therefore, the number of events in spring was too low to include them in
 the analysis.
 For example, the DELWP database regitered 31 events during the December-January
-February (DJF) season over the period 1961-2011.
 The other three seasons of the year registered only 11 events during the
 same period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period of analysis was 1980-2010 and 1974-2010.
 For the first period of analysis used only weather station data.
 For the second period used weather station and reanalysis data.
 The SAM index—AAO— was excluded from the analysis for the second period.
 The AAO did not show a significant correlation with most variables in the
 first period.
 The VSBI was sensitive to the biases in precipitation in the 20CR data.
 Therefore, precipitation from weather stations substituted the 20CR data
 for the period 1974-2010.
 The results highlight the statistically significant results at the 5% level.

shows two times series of seasonal FFDI in Victoria.
 Panel a) presents the results using the first seasonal metric (cummulative
 FFDI).
 Panel b) presents seasonal FFDI as the number of days with a FFDI value
 greater than 25.
 These calcualtions comprise the season DJF during the period 1974-2010.
 Before this period weather stations do not have enough records to compute
 the FFDI.
 Weather station data was necessary to bias-correct the FFDI results calculated
 with reanalysisd data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weather station data represent Victoria with more extreme bushfire weather
 seasons compared to the original (without bias-correction) results using
 reanalysis data.
 In spite of this, the results depict a similar variability for the seasonal
 FFDI metrics.
 Panel a) shows the time series for cummulative FFDI ( r=0.47, p=0.00, n=37),
 and panel b) the correspondineg time series for number of days with FFDI
 greater than 25 (r=0.33, p=0.05, n=37) .
 However, on an interanual basis they differ on magnitude.
 Thefore a bias-correction of reanalysis data was required.

 The day with the highest precipitation allowed to set the soil moisture
 deficit index to zero.
 This step to start the calculations.
 The date was the 22nd of September of 1918 with 62.06 mm.
 Therefore, it was possible to extend the results to the period 1920-2010.

Original seasonal FFDI computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FFDI values computed with weather station data depict more extreme seasonal
 bushfire weather for Victoria than using reanalysis data.
 This difference is likely to occur for several reasons.
 FFDI variables from renalysis data do not correspond exactly to surface
 values.
 Reanalysis data is available from 1000 h-Pa level.
 The FFDI computed with weather station data use values at 3 pm.
 Yet, reanalysis data for FFDI variables is available on at 6-hourly intervals.
 This limited the availability of data to 4 pm values.
 Additionally, there are intrinsic limitations in the reanalysis dataset
 already discussed in Chapter 2.
 Yet, simple linear scaling tecniques demonstrated to adjust the biases
 without signifincatly altering the correlations.
 However, the seasonal bushfire danger determined for this region might
 vary if we use a different bushfire index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the use of an alternitve index might show a different seasonal
 bushfire danger trend, the difference is unlikely to be significant.
 A study performed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dowdy2009"

\end_inset

 determined that the FFDI is comparable to the Canadian Fire Weather Index
 (FWI) for Australian conditions.
 The FWI is an internationally recognized index (citations) that could be
 the most reliable source of comparison.
 Therefore, the results obtained using the FFDI can considered representitive
 of bushfire weather conditions in Victoria.
 In spite that an alternative index might not significantly change the results,
 the use of only mean values of the 20CR brings non-quantified undertainties
 to the seasonal bushfire danger computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The average state of the atmosphere represented by the mean values of the
 20CR derives from the mean of 56 model realizations (citation).
 Every realization represents an equally possible state of the atmosphere
 (citation).
 Thus, the seasonal bushfire danger results computed have a degree of uncertaint
y that has not been quantified.
 The bias-correction results are therefore only valid for one possible state
 of the atmosphere.
 However, most 20CR realizations show an increasing trend in temperature
 consistent with an atmosphere under a global warming process (citations).
 The computed FFDI seasonal metrics‚—which largely depend on temeprature—are
 in agreement with this increasing trend.
 This trend is more pronounced using weather station data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increasing trend in seasonal bushfire danger computations for Victoria
 agrees with the results of other investigations for southeastern Australia
 (citations).
 In fact, climate change is extending the bushfire season globally (citation)
 and also in this region (citation).
 However, the available data bases showed that most bushfires occur during
 DJF (cross-reference).
 Therefore, in this investigation the fire season was defined as the season
 December-January-February.
 Therefore, the results can change—although not significantly- if the bushfire
 season is extended (e.g.
 November-December-January-February-March—).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bias-correction of bushfire weather variables (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most bushfire weather variables showed a significant correlation between
 weather station and 20CR data.
 Temperature, relative humidity and wind speed presented a similar variability
 with differences in magnitud.
 Linear scaling techniques were applied to correct the mean of these three
 variables.
 In this case the results were satisfactory since the correlations among
 weather stations and reanalysis data did not significantly change—in some
 cases improved—.
 Additionally, the bias-correction of reanalysis data produced similar outcomes
 in magnitude for the three variables.
 Although, the bias-corretion process yielded satisfactory results for most
 variables, is important to mention that the weather station data was not
 homogenized.
 This is a limitation that is particularly evident for wind speed.
 The seasonal values fo this variable show an abrupt increase after the
 year 2000.
 This could have been caused by a change in the technology to measure the
 variable.
 On the other hand, biases in precipiation could not be corrected using
 linear scaling tecniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precipitation is not accurately represented in the 20CR data.
 The linear scaling bias-correction techniques did not yield better results
 for this variable.
 The FFDI computation was perfrmed without bias-corecting this variable.
 However, the FFDI is less sensitive to changes to precipitation than the
 other three variables 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dowdy2009"

\end_inset

.
 The diminished degree of influence of precipitation occurs because it is
 not explicitly included in the FFDI equation.
 This variable is part of the drought factor.
 This factor does not include precipitation explicitly either, since its
 computation requires the calculation of moisture deficits—in this research
 calculated with the KBDI—.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bias-corrected seasonal FFDI computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the bias-correction of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed
 reanalysis data, the magnitude of FFDI results is very similar to the results
 using weather station data for the period 1974-2010.
 However, is important to notice that after the bias-corrrection process
 the reanalysis data over-estimates seasonal bushfire potential for both
 metrics of FFDI.
 For most years, this over-estimation is not large, with the exception of
 the years 1991 and 2001.

\begin_layout Standard
FFDI

 The results with FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\end_inset

 show a higher correlation between bushfire danger and activivty, using
 reanalysis and weather station data.
 This hold true for the original calculation as well as in the calculations
 with bias-corrected reanalysis data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extended seasonal FFDI computation (1920-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a final step, the FFDI computation was extended back in time to cover
 the period 1920-2010.
 The FFDI climate variables were bias-corrected for this period using the
 correction factors determined for the period 1974-2010.
 The calculation required to find the date—as further back in time as possible—w
ith the higher precipitation in order to set the soil moisture deficit to
 zero—factor in the KBDI calculation—.
 After the computation, a correlation analysis only for the period were
 FFDI with station data was availale—1974-2010—.
 The results were moderately correlated and similar to those obtained before
 extending the resutls.
 Additionally, the extreme seasons of this time series—after applying a
 85 percentile—are cosnistent with major bushfire occurrences in Vicotria
 (check this estatement).
 For example....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is greater uncertainty in the accuraccy of this computation.
 The increasing trend of seasonal bushfire danger was not detected extending
 the computation for this period.
 This might occur because certain variables could present even larger biases
 with respect to weather station data than those found for the period 1974-2010.
 This might be especially true for wind speed (citation).
 Additionally, after the bias-correction the seasonal FFDI understimates
 bushfire danger compared to the computation using weather station data.
 This FFDI results is not consistent with the trend with the first computation
 that yielded an overstimation.
 Since there is no weather station data to compare the fields for the period
 1920-2010, an alternative approach could be the validation against an independe
nt reanalysis product like ERA-clim

Drivers of bushfire weather 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most notable feature in the relationship between variables in spring
 is the influence of the IOD.
 This climate mode of variability is strongly correlated with climate variables
 and bushfire weather.
 These results agree with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 The authors found that positive IOD events drive hot and dry weather conditions
 in spring in Victoria.
 This effect reduces soil moisture and therefore dries fuel loads.
 The higher availability of these dry fuel loads makes the summer season
 more prone to bushfires.
 The IOD exerts a stronger influence than ENSO in this season.
 This results also agrees with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, is important to notice that I found a strong correlation of IOD
 with ENSO.
 Therefore, this result contributes the debate regarding the actual independence
 of IOD with respect to ENSO (citation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
El Niño indices show how ENSO significantly drives Victorian climate in
 spring.
 Among these indices, el NINO 3.4 showed the strongest relationships with
 climate variables.
 This reflects how the oceanic component of ENSO might drive bushfire weather.
 In fact, SST1.2 showed a very strong correlation with bushfire weather repesente
d as number of days with FFDI greater than 25.
 In the previous chapter it was demonstrated how this regions showed statistical
ly significcant anomalies associated with bushfire occurrences in Victoria.
 This result reinforces the argument to include the SST of this region in
 the VSBI formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SAM does not have a significant influence in preconditioning bushfire seasons.
 This was an unexpected result, since the influence of SAM over rainfall
 in Victoria is well known 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009a,Ho2011"

\end_inset

.
 The reason might be that the computation of the climate indices used a
 different climatology in comparisson to the climatology used to calculate
 the anomalies of the bushfire weather variables (see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Sources-of-monthly-climate-indices"

\end_inset

).
 The climatology used for bushfire variables was 1961-2011, while the limatology
 for SAM was 1979-2000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over all, the correlations between climate modes of variability and bushfire
 weather and activity in DJF are not strong.
 Thus, it is interesting to notice how this differs from the results in
 the previous season.
 The influence of ENSO and IOD is more important in spring than summer.
 Specifically, their contribution is more related to build-up fuels loads
 in spring rather than enhancing bushfire weather already in summer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Climate modes of variability (ENSO and IOD), do not show much skill on thier
 own to forecast bushfire weather.
 The results are slightly better for ENSO indices and DMI when correlated
 to fire activity.
 However, thedifferent climatologies used for the calculation of the indice
 might have an influence in this result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bushfire danger and activity predictors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative humidity and temperature in spring are strong predictors bushfire
 danger and activity in summer.
 On their own, they have higher prediction skill from spring to summer than
 VSBI, FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\end_inset

and FFDI>25.
 Moreover, relative humidity is the variable that most influences bushfire
 weather—measured as VSBI and FFDI— in Victoria.
 This result is consistent using weather station and reanalysis data.
 This is also consistent for the three correlation analysis performed (SON,
 DJF and SON-DJF).
 This result agrees with the findings of (citation) for Australia.
 However, it is worth acknowledging again that weather stations data was
 not homogenized and precipitation from reanalysis data was not bias-corrected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI in spring has a stronger prediction skill of bushfire activity
 than the seasonal metrics of FFDI.
 This skill is higher using weather sation data.
 However, the prediction skill is higher for relative humidity on its own.
 This demonstrates that the reduced computation complexity of the index
 oversimplifies the relationship between bushfire weather variables.
 Therefore, the linear relationship assumption between the VSBI variables
 do not enhance the capability of the index to represent—and predict—bushfire
 danger and activity.
 The amount of data used is relatively short for this type of predictive
 analysis (37 years).
 However, it is unlikely that the VSBI will show greater predictive skill
 than relative humidty of temperature using more years for the analysis.
 Additionally, the choice of the bushfire season (December-January-February)
 or an extended season (November-December-January-February-March) is also
 unlikely to change this result.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal bushfire weather has been explored using seasonal metrics of the
 FDDI (FFDI_cum and FFDI>50) in Victoria for the 20th century.
 For the second half of the century, the relationship between seasonal bushfire
 potential, fire activity and a proposed alternative simple bushfire weather
 index has been investigated.
 The skill for this new index, its variables and ENSO indices to forecast
 seasonal bushfire weather has also been investigated.
 The proposed index has a low skill to forecast bushfire weather (0.3), although
 shows a moderate capability to represent simultaneous bushfire weather
 (compared to seasonal metrics of the FFDI) and fire activity.
 In fact, it relationship to fire activity is actually slightly better than
 the one obtained with the seasonal metrics of the FFDI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows us to present an alternative index to investigate past and future
 seasonal bushfire weather which is more simple to calculate than the FFDI.
 Further refinement of the index would involve the incorporation of a parameter
 that accounts for seasonal frontal activity during the concurrent bushfire
 season.
 It is also important to mention that since it has already been established
 that the IOD preconditions bushfire seasons in Victoria, and we found not
 much skill in ENSO to forecast bushfire weather (but it does have skill
 to forecast precipitation) the refinement of the index might incorporate
 an IOD parameter that has skill to forecast temperature and relative humidity
 behaviour.
