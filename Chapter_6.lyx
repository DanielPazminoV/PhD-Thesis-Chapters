\begin_layout Chapter
Reproducibility of results for Victoria 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 4 and 5 analysed complementary aspects of fire weather in Victoria,
 Australia.
 Chapter 4 examined the differences between bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 On the other hand, Chapter 5 analysed two additional aspects fire weather
 in Victoria.
 It explored the long-term variability and forecasting skill of fire weather
 in this region.
 Chapter 6 aims to test if the findings of these two chapters are robust.
 The investigation reproduces these results using the same methods with
 alternative data sources.
 It also consolidates the discussion about fire weather in Victoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four sections comprise this chapter.
 The data and methodology section provides details about the alternative
 data sources.
 This section also summarises the methods described in the previous chapters.
 However, the reader has references to the corresponding chapters for further
 details about the methodologies.
 The results section reproduces Chapter's 4 and 5 findings.
 The discussion section provides an integrated analysis comparing the original
 and reproduced results.
 The summary gives an overview of the chapter and highlights the key findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data and methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire activity records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bushfire activity records are the same as those used in the previous
 chapters.
 The two datasets were produced by the Department of Environment, Land,
 Water and Planning (DELWP) of Victoria and Risk Frontiers (RF).
 Both datasets are comparable using events greater than 10.000 Ha as the
 threshold to define bushfire events.
 The selected period of analysis using this definition was 1961-2010.
 The datasets have a greater correlation during this time.
 Chapter 4 discusses further details about these datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Heatwave dates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of the experiment conducted in Chapter 4 uses an alternative
 heatwave definition.
 This experiment presents the results using the heatwaves dates computed
 using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 heatwave definition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fire weather metrics are those used in the previous chapter.
 The analyses use two seasonal metrics of the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).
 The first FFDI metric is a cumulative sum of daily FFDI values (FFDIcum).
 The second FFDI metric is the number of days with FFDI greater than 25
 (FFDI>25).
 An alternative metric used was the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (VSBI) proposed in chapter 5.
 Chapters 2 and 5 provide details on the formulation of the FFDI and VSBI
 respectively.
 Chapter 3 presents a critical review of the FFDI.
 Chapter 5 discussed the limitations of the VSBI.
 This chapter further discusses these indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of bushfire and heatwave weather patterns used the same
 climate data as in Chapter 4.
 The climate data used in this chapter was the Twentieth Century Reanalysis
 Project version 2 (20CR), the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
 data set (HadISST1), and the Australian Climate Observations Reference
 Network-Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT).
 Chapter 4 specifies the characteristics of these datasets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, reproducing Chapter 5 results required an alternative
 source of reanalysis data.
 During the execution of this research project, the European Centre for
 Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) launched the European Reanalysis
 of Global Climate Observations ERA-Clim project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stickler2014,Stickler2014a"

\end_inset

.
 This investigation used one of its products: the ERA-20C twentieth-century
 reanalysis.
 ERA-20C, assimilated surface pressure data—as well as marine wind observations—
and used sea surace temperatues and sea ice concentrations as boundary condition
s.
 It comprises a dataset that provides 3-hourly data, with 125 Km spatial
 resolution and 92 vertical levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the ERA-20C dataset has several advantages for this research
 project.
 First of all, it provides data with higher resolution.
 ERA-20C provides data with a 125 Km spatial resolution, while the 20CR
 outputs only reach 200 Km.
 Secondly, the ERA-20C data yield surface—10m—climate data.
 On the other hand, version 2 of the 20CR—which was used when the project
 started—only provides values at the 1000 hPa level.
 Therefore, ERA-20C required less bias-corrections.
 Finally, ERA-20C provides a dataset to assess the results independently.
 Even though alternative ensemble members of the 20CR could have been used
 to reproduce the results, the use of a different reanalysis product could
 confirm that the results are robust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, ERA-20C also has limitations.
 This reanalysis product yields data from 1900 to 2010, while the 20CR project
 covers a larger period (1851-2014).
 Nevertheless, the analyses conducted in the previous chapters do not use
 years before 1900.
 Therefore, this limitation is not a disadvantage for this project.
 Additionally, ERA-20C is a deterministic model.
 It provides only one ensemble of data.
 In contrast, the 20CR yields 56 realisations of possible states of the
 climate.
 This investigation has only used the ensemble mean of the 20CR.
 Thus, the deterministic nature of the ERA-20CR is not a disadvantage either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter uses the same climate indices analysed in previous chapters.
 These include El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices such as NINO
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.4
\end_layout

\end_inset

, NINO
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1+2
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
 It also uses the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) which quantifies the intensity
 of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events.
 Chapter 2 provides further details about ENSO and IOD and their indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Composite analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The composite analysis reproduces the results obtained in Chapter 4.
 These computations facilitate the comparison of bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 The calculations included daily and seasonal composites spanning the period
 1961-2010.
 The daily plots compare weather patterns before and after (from day minus
 1 to day plus one) of the events.
 The seasonal composites display the differences during the antecedent (Septembe
r-October-November) and concurrent (December-January-February) bushfire/heatwave
 seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this test, the bushfire composites use the Risk Frontiers bushfire database
 (RF).
 On the other hand, the criteria defined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Pezza2012"

\end_inset

 is adopted as a second heatwave definition.
 These data is used to test the sensitivity of the results.
 The analysis excluded days in which bushfire and heatwaves occurred simultaneou
sly.
 This procedure allowed producing plots that represent each type of event
 exclusively.
 Chapter 4 further describes the composite analysis methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather variability analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
​This sub-section replicates the results produced in Chapter 5.
 Fire weather variability was explored using seasonal metrics of the FFDI
 as well as the VSBI.
 For this experiment, the calculations used the ERA-20C as an alternative
 source of data.
 The first step in this process was to compare the reanalysis data against
 observations.
 This comparison used probability density functions and seasonal time series
 to evaluate if any bias-corrections were required.
 Initially, the climate data analysis was conducted for the period of available
 weather station data (1974-2010).
 However, time series were also plotted for the period 1920-2010 using the
 reanalysis data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently, the climate data was used to compute the FFDI (FFDIcum and
 FFDI>25) and VSBI.
 These computations analysed fire weather variability during the bushfire
 season (December-January-February).
 The calculations used observations and reanalysis data for the period 1974-2010.
 The analysis for the period 1920-2010 used reanalysis data only.
 Chapter 5 describes more details of the methodology to analyse fire weather
 variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Seasonal forecasting skill analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sub-section reproduces the findings for seasonal forecasting skill
 (see Chapter 5).
 In this analysis, linear correlations were used to understand the relationship
 between four groups of data.
 The data comprised weather variables, climate indices, fire weather metrics
 and fire activity records.
 The exploration of the relationships between these groups of data included
 the seasons September-October-November (SON-SON), December-January-February
 (DJF-DJF), and from spring to summer (SON-DJF).
 The analysis included three periods for each season: 1974-2010, 1961-2010
 and 1920-2010.
 The first period includes correlations using weather station data.
 The second period covers the entire length of bushfire activity records.
 The last period spans most of the reanalysis dataset coverage.
 Chapter 5 presents finer aspects of the methodology for this analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results section comprises three parts.
 The first sub-section displays the results of bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 The next sub-section shows the fire weather variability results.
 The last section analyses seasonal climate-bushfire relationships and fire
 weather forecasting skill.
\end_layout

Bushfire and heatwave weather patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sub-section aims to reproduce the results of bushfire and heatwave
 weather patterns.
 It presents daily and seasonal composites using an alternative bushfire
 database.
 For this experiment, Risk Frontiers provided the bushfire records (RF).
 Additionally, the investigation used a second heatwave definition.

 shows a time series of bushfire and heatwave events in Victoria during
 the period 1961-2010.
 Panel a) shows the evolution of extreme bushfire events in this region
 using the RF database.
 According to its records, there is no evident trend in the occurrence of
 bushfires during this period.
 As expected, they seem to peak during very strong negative phases of the
 Southern Oscillation Index (shown in blue lines).
 However, the long-term relationship shows a rather weak relationship (r=-0.33).
 On the other hand, panel b) displays a time series of heatwaves using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 definition during the same period.
 The panel shows that extreme heatwaves occur less frequently than extreme
 fire events.
 Additionally, there is no correlation between the heatwave and SOI time
 series (r=-0.04).

 The computation considered fire records only in Victoria.
 However, the hot anomalies influence several regions in Australia.
 It directly affects Victoria and Southern Australia; as well as sectors

 Strait.
 During this day, Queensland and the coastal West Australia present cold
 anomalies.
 Extreme bushfires start (day 0) when a cold front reduces the hot anomalous
 region.
 A day after the cold front passage, warm anomalies are still present in
 Victoria, New South Wales and the Northen Territory.

 During day -1, heatwaves show more intense anomalies than bushfires.
 The extent of the region affected by hot anomalies is also greater.
 This area even includes the coastal area of West Australia.
 Heatwaves and bushfires present cold anomalies in Queensland a day before
 the start of the events.
 When heatwaves start (day 0), the hot anomalies remain without substantial
 change.
 In contrast, the cold anomalies in Queensland become slightly stronger.
 Addtionally, the coastal region of Western Australia starts presenting
 cold anomalies as well.
 During the second day of heatwaves (day +1), the hot anomalies persist.
 However, there is a slight increase of cold anomalies in Western Australia.

McArthur Forest Fire Danger computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of fire weather variability started with the computation of
 the FFDI.
 The computation used weather station data as well as an alternative reanalysis
 dataset (ERA-20C).
 The period of analysis was 1974-2010.
 Weather station data was available only for this period.
 The computed FFDI was analysed using probability density functions and
 time series.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probability-density-functions-FFDI"

\end_inset

 shows that the distributions of the FFDI computed with reanalysis and weather
 station data are quite similar.
 The same procedure was applied to each FFDI variable.
 Additionally, the verifications also included comparisons between time
 series with orignal and bias-corrected data.
 These steps revealed that precipitation could be bias-corected using linear
 scaling techniques.

Bushfire and heatwave weather patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of the analysis comparing bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns confirms the results found in Chapter 4.
 The results are robust for daily as well as seasonal time scales.
 The linkages with ENSO patterns also remain valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The daily composites show the most consistent results.
 For air temperature, using alternative bushfire and heatwave data reveals
 that the differences in their weather patterns remain.
 Cold fronts remain the most important fire weather feature.
 On the other hand, persistent heat anomalies characterize heatwaves events.
 Relative humidity patterns confirm that heatwaves in Victoria present dry
 anomalies in this region with wet anomlies in several other areas of the
 continent.
 During bushfires in Victoria, Australia is predominantly dry.
 The composites produced using alternative data are also capable of reproducing
 the contrasting intensity of the wave patterns during bushfires and heatwaves.
 These anomalies also confirm the intense wave train pattern linked to frontal
 activity during fire events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a daily time scale, the results show that the intensity of the frontal
 activity is the most important feature of extreme fire weather in Victoria.
 Therefore, evaluating the frontal activity strength should be a priority
 in daily fire weather forecasts.
 However, it seems that the current state of practise heavily relies on
 the the FFDI.
 This index is most sensitive to temperature.
 Consequently, fire weather danger estimated by the FFDI might be misleading
 during heatwave events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternative indices based on the effect of frontal activity over extreme
 fire weather have already been published in the literature.

 proposed a simple alternative based on this criteria.
 The author argues that measuring the 850 hPa horizontal temperature gradient
 is a useful metric to anticipate extreme fire weather.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 proposed a similar parameter.
 They used the difference in surface temperature after cold front passages
 (∆ 17 
\begin_inset script superscript

\end_inset

C) to identify extreme fire weather days.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Mills2005"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Reeder2015"

\end_inset

 criteria have been used to study past extreme fire weather and make projections
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hasson2009"

\end_inset

).
 Since there are already alternative fire weather metrics on a daily time
 scale this research focused on the development of a new index for seasonal
 prediction.
 Therefore, the seasonal patterns are also discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a seasonal time scale, bushfire and heatwave weather patterns also display
 contrasting patterns.
 During extreme fire activity in Victoria the weather patterns consistently
 show warming anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
 On the other hand, hetwaves do not seem to be linked to any activity on
 this region.
 Perhaps, the most interesting pattern for heatwaves was a dipole structure
 of warm and sligthly cool sea surface temperature anomalies in the southern
 Indian Ocean.
 This suggests that different mechanisms drive these two type of events
 on this time scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a link between “El Niño” events and fire activity in Victoria.
 The linear correlation analyses in this thesis, as well as in other studies
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

), agree with this finding.
 However, this is the first study to use composites to investigate this
 relationship.
 This methodology is useful to understand the average condition of the climate
 system.
 Nevertheless, it also has limitations.
 Not every “El Niño” phase brings extreme fires.
 In fact, ENSO and fire activity in Victoria have a moderate—or even weak—inter-
annual relationship.
 Analysing the bushfire weather pattern recurrence in different ENSO phases
 could provide further insights.
 For example, using this approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Verdon-Kidd2008a"

\end_inset

 investigated synoptic patterns useful to forecast rainfall in this region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional limitation to investigate bushfire weather patterns is the
 lack of fire records.
 The seasonal composites are sensitive to this caveat.
 For example, scarce areas in the tropical Pacific Ocean show statistical
 significance.
 The areas selected to develop the VSBI are an exception.
 This result contrasts with the strong statistical significance that the
 daily composites display.
 This absence of statistical significance occurs with the two bushfire databases
 used.
 The “El Niño” signal is clear during fire season.
 However, the analysis requires more data to have greater confidence in
 the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to fire weather, heatwaves do not show a strong association
 with ENSO.
 The results are consistent using two different heatwave definitions.
 This finding agrees with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Boschat2014"

\end_inset

.
 The authors showed that most heatwaves in Victoria occur in neutral ENSO
 conditions—.
 In contrast, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Parker2014"

\end_inset

 found that Victoria tends to experience heatwaves events during “La Niña”
 phase.
 Evidently, these disagreements require further investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future investigation about seasonal heatwave weather patterns could consider
 several aspects.
 First of all, extending the period of analysis is feasible.
 There is available data from the early years of the 20th century to undertake
 this analysis.
 However, this study aimed to compare heatwave and bushfire weather patterns.
 Therefore the period of analysis comprises the year with consistent fire
 records (1961-2010).
 Additionally, future investigations could focus on investigating the intra-seas
onal relationships that enhance heatwaves.
 Low-frequency modes of variability do not seem to drive heatwaves.
 Finally, simple composite analysis limit the ability to discuss the dynamics
 with climate drivers.
 Therefore, complementing the composites with numerical experiments could
 provide further insights (e.g.

 Not surprisingly, FFDI metrics display a greater increase in fire danger
 than the VSBI.
 This difference occurs because the FFDI is more sensitive to temperature.
 This variable display with increasing trends.
 Additionally, this tendency is stronger considering every day in the fire
 season.
 The FFDI

.
 However, FFDI

 might not accurately identify the extreme fire weather days.
 As already discussed, cold fronts characterise extreme fire weather days
 better than extreme temperature.
 This section also discusses the relationship between ENSO and fire weather.

Strong “El Niño” years bring high fire danger to Victoria.
 The VSBI shows that the years with the highest fire danger are those during
 a strong “El Niño” phase (e.g.
 1982-1983 and 1997-1998).
 However, the VSBI might overestimate ENSO's influence on fire danger.
 The FFDI shows that strong “El Niño” years are not the most threatening.
 Although, the FFDI demonstrates that they can pose a significant risk.
 FFDI metrics show that the seasons 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 are among the
 most dangerous during the period 1974-2010.
 The FFDIcum metric categorise them among the five seasons with the highest
 fire danger.
 Using the FFDI>25metric, these seasons comprise the top seven years.
 The discussion about ENSO a fire weather metrics continues in the next
 section.
 This section also aims to discuss the fire weather changes before the observati
onal period.

\begin_layout Standard
Reanalysis data shows substantial differences in their ability to represent
 long-term fire weather changes.
 Overall, ERA-20C has a greater skill to capture fire weather variability
 than 20CR.
 Indeed, this reanalysis product shows better correlations with observations
 for two reasons.
 First of all, it has a higher resolution (ERA-20C: 1.5

x1.5

).
 Additionally, ERA-20C yields surface (10 m) climate fields.
 On the other hand, the 20CR (version 2) provides data only at the 1000
 hPa level.
 Therefore, most fire weather variables did not require bias-corrections
 using this dataset.
 On the other hand, the 20CR better represents the observed fire danger
 trend in Victoria.
 The 20CR data also shows this trend for the period 1974-2010.
 In fact, it shows that this trend can be traced back to the early decades
 of the 20

 century.
 Additionally, this tendency is consistent using three fire weather metrics
 (FFDI

 and VSBI).
 However, the results using ERA-20C do not support this finding.

 Using these records,

 analysed climate variability in Southeastern Australia for the period 1860-2009.
 This research also used the 20CR data.
 Therefore, it is useful for verification.
 The study shows that temperature observations have a clear increasing trend.
 On the other hand, observed rainfall displays the opposite pattern.
 The 20CR agrees with these long-term trends.
 Although, there is greater uncertainty before 1900.
 In contrast, this thesis shows that ERA-20C is not able to capture the
 observed trends.
 Therefore, further reasearch could quantify uncertainties in past fire
 weather changes using different ensembles of the 20CR.

\begin_layout Subsection
Fire weather metrics, drivers and predictability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section re-examines several aspects already discussed in Chapter 5.
 First of all, the performance of the VSBI in comparison to seasonal metrics
 of the FFDI.
 Additionally, the influence of local climate variables and remote drivers
 on fire weather.
 Finally, it discusses the potential to predict extreme fire weather in
 Victoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI shows that it can represent fire weather and its relationship with
 bushfires.
 For example, the index demonstrated to be an equivalent metric in comparison
 to the FFDI.
 The results show that they are highly correlated during spring and summer.
 Moreover, VSBI and FFDI show similar correlations with fire activity in
 summer.
 The index also showed to be a useful forecasting tool (as discussed later
 in this section).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to its accuracy, the VSBI has the advantage to be simpler to
 compute than the FFDI.
 It represents fire danger based on a simple relationship between climate
 variables and ENSO.
 Therefore, it could become useful in studies that require large computing
 resources.
 In contrast, the FFDI incorporate factors and sub-indices that increase
 the computation complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the VSBI also has caveats.
 First of all, it does not represent the "true" physical relationship between
 its variables.
 In fact, the VSBI linear formulation masks their real contribution to fire
 danger.
 For example, the SSTs influence is lower in comparison to local climate
 variables.
 Therefore, the VSBI equation might overestimate its effect on fire weather.
 The linear formulation of the VSBI also fails to reflect the actual non-linear
 nature of ENSO.
 Additionally, some of the VSBI variables are directly correlated (e.g., temperatu
re and relative humidity).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite its limitations, the VSBI was useful to understand fundamental relations
hips.
 The correlations showed that regional climate conditions drive fire weather
 in Victoria.
 In contrast, remote drivers have less influence than climate variables
 (as expected).
 These findings agree with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
 However, climate modes of variability do play a role in driving fire weather.
 For example, ENSO and IOD moderately influence relative humidity.
 This variable showed to be the principal component of fire weather metrics.
 Additionally, these remote drivers also demonstrated to have a moderate
 influence on fire activity.
 However, ENSO and IOD's influence is not constant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The influence of remote climate drivers over fire weather decays from spring
 to summer.
 During spring, the IOD exerts a slightly higher level of control than ENSO
 (according to observations).
 Indeed, this study found no strong evidence to show that the IOD has a
 significantly higher influence than ENSO during this season.
 In fact, these two climate modes are highly correlated.
 The correlations displayed in Chapter 5 show similar results.
 These findings contrast with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

 who argue that the IOD be the leading driver that preconditions fuel loads
 to fires.
 On the other hand, during summer, the IOD does not exert influence over
 fire weather.
 This behaviour was expected from its seasonal dynamics.
 Unexpectedly, the influence of ENSO weakens during this season.
 Therefore, the effect of remote climate drivers is greater in spring than
 summer.
 This finding supports the argument that a fire weather forecasting tool
 can be developed using —antecedent—remote climate drivers information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI shows a strong forecasting skill.
 Indeed, the index has greater predictive power than climate variables and
 indices on their own.
 Additionally, the correlations show a greater skill to predict fire weather
 than bushfires.
 This result shows physical consistency.
 These findings are based on the analysis of observations.
 However, some of the disagreements found in Chapter 5 using the 20CR persisted
 using in the analysis with ERA-20C.
 For example, a greater predictive ability for forecast fire events rather
 than fire weather.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reanalysis datasets showed similar limitations to reproduce the results
 using observations.
 Particularly, in the last two chapters.
 In contrast, they showed agreement when used to investigate large-scale
 weather patterns.
 Therefore, their resolution seems to be a caveat to conduct this regional
 climate study.
 Probably, better results could be achieved increasing the size of the study
 region (e.g.
 southeastern Australia).

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter aimed to reproduce the results generated for Victoria.
 The use of alternative data confirmed the differences between bushfire
 and heatwave weather patterns in this region.
 A strong temperature gradient in southern Australia—produced by cold fronts—and
 a dry pattern over the continent characterise extreme fire weather.
 In contrast, heatwaves show persistent hot anomalies and a contrasting
 dry-wet pattern in Australia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the use of an alternative reanalysis dataset shows that the
 models have different capabilities to represent fire weather.
 The 20CR dataset captures the observed—increasing—trend in fire weather.
 On the other hand, ERA-20C showed better skill to represent inter-annual
 fire weather changes.
 The ERA-20C data also verified that the VSBI has a similar skill than FFDI
 metrics to represent fire weather.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, a re-examination of the results using observations confirms
 that the VSBI has a strong fire weather forecasting skill.
 The incorporation of an ENSO indicator in this index shows that it increases
 its predictive capability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next chapter investigates fire weather in Ecuador.
 The study is probably the first to explore this topic in the tropical Andes.
 It aims to verify if the FFDI is a useful metric in this region.
 The chapter also investigates the relationship between ENSO and fire weather.
 This research provides insights of ENSO's influence in modulating fire
 weather in the Southern Hemisphere.
