\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 4 and 5 analysed complementary aspects of fire weather in Victoria,
 Australia.
 Chapter 4 examined the differences between bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 On the other hand, Chapter 5 analysed fire weather variability and seasonal
 forecasting skill.
 This chapter aims to test if the findings of these two chapters are robust.
 Chapter 6 reproduces these results using the same methods with alternative
 data sources.
 The chapter consolidates the discussion about fire weather in Victoria
 with consistent results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four sections comprise this chapter.
 The data and methodology section provides details about the alternative
 data sources.
 It also summarises the methods described in the analogous sections of the
 preceding chapters.
 However, the reader has references to the corresponding chapters for more
 methodological aspects.
 The results section reproduces the findings of chapters 4 and 5.
 The discussion section provides a deeper analysis of the original and reproduce
d results.
 The summary gives an overview of the chapter and highlights the key findings.

\begin_layout Section
Data and methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire activity records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bushfire activity records are the same as those used in the previous
 chapters.
 The two datasets were produced by the Department of Environment, Land,
 Water and Planning (DELWP) of Victoria and Risk Frontier's (RF).
 Both datasets are comparable using events greater than 10.000 Ha as the
 threshold to define bushfire events.
 The selected period of analysis using this definition was 1961-2010.
 The datasets have a greater correlation during this time.
 Chapter 4 discusses further details about these datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Heatwave dates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of the experiment conducted in Chapter 4 uses an alternative
 heatwave definition.
 This experiment present the results using the heatwaves dates computed
 in Chapter 4 using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 heatwave definition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fire weather metrics are those used in the previous chapter.
 The analyses use two seasonal metrics of the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).
 The first FFDI metric is a cumulative sum of all FFDI daily values (FFDIcum).
 The second FFDI metric is the number of days with FFDI greater than 25
 (FFDI>25).
 The third metric is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (VSBI) proposed in chapter 5.
 Chapters 2 and 5 provide details on the formulation of the FFDI and VSBI
 respectively.
 Chapter 4 presents a critical review of the FFDI.
 Chapter 5 discussed the limitations of the VSBI.
 This chapter further discusses these indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of weather patterns used the same climate data as in Chapter
 4.
 The sensitivity of these results was tested using alternative bushfire
 dataset and heatwave definition.
 The results are more sensible to these parameters.
 Therefore, the climate data used in this chapter was the Twentieth Century
 Reanalysis Project version 2 (20CR), the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea
 Surface Temperature data set (HadISST1), and the Australian Climate Observation
s Reference Network-Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT).
 Chapter 4 specifies the characteristics of these datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reproducing Chapter 5 results required an alternative source of reanalysis
 data.
 During the execution of this research project, the European Centre for
 Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) launched the European Reanalysis
 of Global Climate Observations ERA-Clim project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stickler2014,Stickler2014a"

\end_inset

.
 This investigation used one of its products: the ERA-20C twentieth-century
 reanalysis.
 ERA-20C, assimilated surface pressure data—as well as marine wind observations—
and used sea surace temperatues and sea ice concentrations as boundary condition
s.
 It comprises a dataset that provides 3-hourly data, with 125 Km spatial
 resolution and 92 vertical levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the ERA-20C dataset has several advantages for this research
 project.
 First of all, it provides data with higher resolution.
 ERA-20C provides data with a 125 Km spatial resolution, while the 20CR
 outputs only reach 200 Km.
 Secondly, the ERA-20C data yield surface—10m—climate data.
 On the other hand, version 2 of the 20CR—which was used when the project
 started—only provides values at the 1000 hPa level.
 Therefore, bias-corrections were required to use this the 20CR data.
 Finally, ERA-20C provides a dataset to assess the results independently.
 Even though alternative ensemble members of the 20CR could have been used
 to reproduce the results, the use of a different reanalysis product could
 confirm that the results are robust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, ERA-20C also has limitations.
 This reanalysis product yields data from 1900 to 2010, while the 20CR project
 covers a larger period (1851-2014).
 Nevertheless, the analyses conducted in the previous chapters do not use
 years before 1900.
 Therefore, this limitation is not a disadvantage for this project.
 Additionally, ERA-20C is a deterministic model.
 It provides only one ensemble of data.
 In contrast, the 20CR yields 56 realisations of possible states of the
 climate.
 This investigation has only used the ensemble mean of the 20CR.
 Thus, the deterministic nature of the ERA-20CR is not a disadvantage either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter uses the same climate indices analysed in previous chapters.
 These include El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices such as NINO3.4.,
 NINO1+2 (SST1.2.), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
 It also uses the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) which quantifies the intensity
 of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events.
 Chapter 1 provides further details about ENSO and IOD and their indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Composite analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The composite analysis reproduces the results obtained in chapter 4.
 These computations facilitate the comparison of bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 The calculations included daily and seasonal composites spanning the period
 1961-2010.
 The daily plots compare weather patterns before and after (from day minus
 1 to day plus one) of the events.
 The seasonal composites display the differences during the antecedent (Septembe
r-October-November) and concurrent (December-January-February) bushfire/heatwave
 seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this test, the bushfire composites use the Risk Frontiers bushfire database
 (RF).
 On the other hand, the criteria defined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Pezza2012"

\end_inset

 is adopted as a second heatwave definition.
 These data is used to test the sensitivity of the results.
 The analysis excluded days in which bushfire and heatwaves occurred simultaneou
sly.
 This procedure allowed producing plots that represent each type of event
 exclusively.
 Chapter 4 further describes the composite analysis methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather variability analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
​This sub-section replicates the results produced in chapter 5.
 Fire weather variability was explored using seasonal metrics of the FFDI
 as well as the VSBI.
 For this experiment, the calculations used the ERA-20C as an alternative
 source of data.
 The first step in this process was to compare the reanalysis data against
 observations.
 This comparison used probability density functions and seasonal time series
 to evaluate if any bias-corrections were required.
 Initially, the climate data analysis was conducted for the period of available
 weather station data (1974-2010).
 However, time series were also plotted for the period 1920-2010 using the
 reanalysis data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently, the climate data was used to compute the FFDI (FFDIcum and
 FFDI>25) and VSBI.
 These computations analysed fire weather variability during the bushfire
 season (December-January-February).
 The calculations used observations and reanalysis data for the period 1974-2010.
 The analysis for the period 1920-2010 used reanalysis data only.
 Chapter 5 describes more details of the methodology to analyse fire weather
 variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Seasonal forecasting skill analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sub-section reproduces the findings for seasonal forecasting skill
 (see chapter 5).
 In this analysis, linear correlations were used to understand the relationship
 between four groups of data.
 The data comprised weather variables, climate indices, fire weather metrics
 and fire activity records.
 The exploration of the relationships between these groups of data included
 the seasons September-October-November (SON-SON), December-January-February
 (DJF-DJF), and from spring to summer (SON-DJF).
 The analysis included three periods for each season: 1974-2010, 1961-2010
 and 1920-2010.
 The first period includes correlations using weather station data.
 The second period covers the entire length of bushfire activity records.
 The last period spans most of the reanalysis dataset coverage.
 Chapter 5 presents finer aspects of the methodology for this analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results section comprises three parts.
 The first sub-section presents the results of bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns.
 It aims to show material to establish comparisons with chapter 4.
 The results from the subsequent sub-sections allow a deeper discussion
 of chapter 5 findings.
 The sub-sections present the results of seasonal fire weather variability
 and forecasting skill.

 For this experiment, Risk Frontiers provided the bushfire records (RF).
 Additionally, the investigation used a second heatwave definition.

 shows a time series of bushfire and heatwave events in Victoria during
 the period 1961-2010.
 Panel a) shows the evolution of extreme bushfire events in this region
 using the RF database.
 According to its records, there is no evident trend in the occurrence of
 bushfires during this period.
 As expected, they seem to peak during very strong negative phases of the
 Southern Oscillation Index (shown in blue lines).
 However, the long-term relationship shows a rather weak relationship (r=-0.33).
 On the other hand, panel b) displays a time series of heatwaves using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 definition during the same period.
 The panel shows that extreme heatwaves occur less frequently than extreme
 fire events.
 Additionally, there is no correlation between the heatwave and SOI time
 series (r=-0.04).

C) during day -1.
 The computation only took into account fire records in Victoria.
 However, the hot anomalies influence several regions in Australia.
 It directly affects Victoria and Southern Australia; as well as sectors
 of West Australia, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the Bass
 Strait.
 During this day, Queensland and the coastal West Australia present cold
 anomalies.
 During the start day of the bushfires (day 0), a cold front reduces the
 hot anomalous region.
 A day after the cold front passage, warm anomalies are still present in
 Victoria, New South Wales and the Northen Territory.

C) during the three days.
 During day -1, heatwaves show perhaps even more intense anomalies than
 bushfires.
 The extent of the region affected by hot anomalies is also greater in compariso
n to bushfires.
 This area even includes the coastal area of West Australia.
 Heatwaves and bushfires present cold anomalies in Queensland a day before
 the start of the events.
 When heatwaves start (day 0), the hot anomalies remains without substantial
 change.
 In contrast, the cold anomalies in Queensland become slightly stronger.
 While the coastal region of West Australia starts presenting cold anomalies
 as well.
 During the second day of heatwaves (day +1), the hot anomalies continue
 constantly.
 However, there is a slight increase of cold anomalies in West Australia.

 A day before the start of bushfires, Victoria shows strong negative anomalies
 (-15%).
 In contrast, the coastal region of West Australia presents wet anomalies.
 When bushfires start (day 0), the cold front significantly reduces the
 area affected by dry anomalies.
 Although Victoria remains extremely dry.
 One day after bushfire were triggered, the cold front brings wet anomalies
 to most of Australia.
 However, Victoria and New South Wales still present dry anomalies (-5%).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The behaviour of relative humidity anomalies during heatwaves does not present
 significant changes.
 During day -1, strong negative anomalies (-15%) affect South Australia.
 Although, this dry pattern also influences Victoria.
 To a lesser extent this anomalies affect the rest of the continent.
 Weak wet anomalies surround the overall dry pattern.
 At day zero—when heatwaves start—, the dry anomalies concentrate in Southern
 Australia and Victoria.
 In contrast, the wet anomalies during this day become stronger.
 During the second day of the heatwaves, the synoptic pattern resembles

McArthur Forest Fire Danger computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of fire weather variability started with the computation of
 the FFDI.
 The computation used weather station data as well as an alternative reanalysis
 dataset (ERA-20C).
 The period of analysis was 1974-2010.
 Weather station data was only available for this period.
 The computed FFDI was analysed using probability density functions and
 time series.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probability-density-functions-FFDI"

\end_inset

 shows that the distributions of the FFDI computed reanalysis and weather
 station data are quite similar.
 The same procedure was applied to each FFDI.
 Additionally, the verifications also included comparissons including time
 series.
 These steps revealed that precipitation could be bias-corected.
 Bias-corrected precipitation data was later used to attempt an improvement
 of the FFDI results.
 However, after the bias-correcting this variable there were no improvements
 in the resutls as figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, panel a) in figure

 Therefore, the precipitation values were bias-corrected using a multiplicative
 linear scaling factor of 3.08.
 This factor was the result of dividing the mean of the two time-series.
 As shown in panel b) in figure

\begin_layout Subsection
Bushfire and heatwave weather patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication of the analysis comparing bushfire and heatwave weather
 patterns confirms the results found in Chapter 4.
 The results are robust for daily as well as seasonal time scales.
 The linkages with ENSO patterns also remain valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The daily composites are perhaps the most consistent results.
 For air temperature, using alternative bushfire and heatwave data shows
 that the differences in their weather patterns persist.
 Cold fronts remain the most important feature of fire weather.
 On the other hand persistent heat anomalies characterize heatwaves events.
 The relative humidity patterns confirm that heatwaves inVictoria present
 dry anomalies in this region, with wet anomlies in several other areas
 of the continent.
 During bushfires in Victoria, Australia is predominantly dry.
 The alternative data also is capable of reproducing the contrasting intensity
 of the wave patterns during bushfires and heatwaves.
 Heatwaves present more intense geopotential height anomalies than bushfires.
 These anomalies also confirm the more dynamic nature of fire weather.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a daily time scale, the results show that the intensity of the frontal
 activity is the most important feature of extreme fire weather in Victoria.
 Therefore, indices aiming to predict fire weather with days in advance
 should focus on metrics to evaluate the strength of cold fronts.
 This contradicts the current state of practise where the FFDI, an index
 whose most sensitive paramater is temperature, is the most commonly used
 tool for fire emergencies.
 Consequently, fire weather danger estimated by the FFDI might be misleading
 during heatwave events.
 This finding is a key message from this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternative indices based on the leading effect of frontal activity over
 extreme fire weather have already been published in the literature

 The author argues that measuring the 850 hPa horizontal temperature gradient
 is a useful metric to anticipate extreme fire weather.

 criteria could be used to study past extreme fire weather and make projections
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hasson2009"

\end_inset

).
 Since there are already alternative fire weather metrics on a daily time
 scale this research focused on the development of a new index for seasonal
 prediction.
 Therefore, the seasonal patterns are also discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a seasonal time scale, bushfire and heatwave weather patterns also display
 contrasting patterns.
 During extreme fire activity in Victoria the weather patterns consistently
 show warming anomalies in the tropical Pacific.
 On the other hand, hetwaves do not seem to be linked to any activity on
 the tropical pacific Ocean.
 Perhaps, the most interesting pattern for heatwaves was a dipole structure
 of warm and sligthly cool sea surface temperature anomalies in the southern
 Indian Ocean.
 This suggests that different mechanisms drive these two type of events
 on this time scale.
 This thesis focused on further investigating the fire weather and activity
 drivers.

Fire weather metrics, drivers and predictability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, ERA-20C data reveal more consistency with observations than its
 20CR counterpart.
 Therefore, this part of the discussion re-examines several aspects already
 discussed in Chapter 5.
 For example, the performance of the VSBI in comparison to seasonal metrics
 of the FFDI.
 Additionally, it also debates the influence of local climate variables
 and remote drivers of fire weather.
 Finally, it discusses the potential to predict seasonal fire weather and
 activity in Victoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI is an equivalent metric of fire weather in comparison to seasonal
 metrics of the FFDI.
 The results show that they are highly correlated during spring and summer.
 They also show that their relationship with fire activity in summer is
 similar.
 The simplification of the relationships between variables in the VSBI equation
 does not demonstrate to significantly affect the results in comparison
 to the FFDI.
 Additionally, the VSBI has the advantage to be simpler to compute than
 the FFDI.
 However, the VSBI equation might overestimate ENSO's influence over fire
 weather.
 In fact, the correlations show that its influence is considerably lower
 in comparison to local climate variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional climate conditions drive fire weather in Victoria.
 The results demonstrate that remote drivers have less influence than climate
 variables.
 These findings agree with

 However, climate modes of variability do play a role in driving fire weather.
 For example, ENSO and IOD moderately influence relative humidity.
 This variable showed to be the principal component of fire weather metrics.
 Additionally, it also demonstrated to have a moderate influence on fire
 activity.
 However, ENSO and IOD's influence is not constant.

\begin_layout Standard
Remote fire weather drivers evolve from spring to summer.
 During spring, the IOD and ENSO show a similar level of influence.
 Furthermore, these two climate modes are highly correlated.
 This result is consistent with the correlations presented in Chapter 5.
 This finding contrast with

 This thesis found no evidence to show that the IOD has a significantly
 higher influence than ENSO during this season.
 On the other hand, during summer, the IOD does not exert influence over
 fire weather.
 This behaviour was expected from the seasonal dynamic of this driver.
 Unexpectedly, the influence of ENSO weakens during this season.
 Previous studies (e.g.

) used an extended fire season (November-March) which did not allow analyse
 the evolution of the influence of this driver.
 This finding suggests that the effect of remote climate drivers is greater
 in spring than summer.
 The weather patterns consistently support this thesis.

The VSBI computed using observational data shows a high forecasting skill.
 These data also demonstrate that the VSBI has greater predictive power
 than climate variables and indices.
 Additionally, results using observations show coherent relationships between
 the prediction of fire weather and activity.
 For example, greater skill to predict fire weather than activity.
 On the other hand, using reanalysis data, there is consistency to show
 that the VSBI has greater forecasting skill than climate indices.
 However, some inconsistencies persist using ERA-20C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI does not show entirely consistent results using reanalysis data.
 In spite that the ERA-20C data demonstrates a greater level of agreement
 with observations than 20CR; these data shows that the index has a comparable
 forecasting skill than climate variables.
 Additionally, both reanalysis datasets show the greater predictive ability
 for fire events rather than fire weather.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These inconsistencies show the limitations of these reanalysis datasets
 to conduct regional climate studies.
 Their resolution could be a caveat for this analysis.
 In contrast, both datasets showed substantial agreement when they were
 used to investigate large-scale weather patterns.
 On the other hand, data from more weather stations may be necessary to
 have more robust agreements—currently not available—.
