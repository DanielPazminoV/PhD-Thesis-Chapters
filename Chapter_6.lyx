\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire activity records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment analysed the same bushfire activity datasets used in the
 previous chapter.
 Additionally, the definitions of bushfire event remain the same.
 A bushfire event in Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water and
 Planning (DELWP) dataset refers to any event that burnt more than 10.000
 hectares.
 Risk Frontiers (RF) database defines a bushfire as the consolidation of
 several bushfire—newspaper—reports in Victoria.
 Using these definitions, both datasets are comparable as demonstrated in
 chapter 4.
 The period of validated bushfire records data is 1961-2010.
 December-January-February (DJF) is the selected bushfire season in this
 investigation, since extreme bushfire occurrences are scarce in other months.
 For example, the DELWP database regitered 31 events during the DJF season
 over the period 1961-2011.
 The other three seasons of the year registered only 11 events during the
 same period.
 The investigation before this period requires alternative variables such
 as fire weather metrics.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fire weather metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantification of fire weather required the computation of the McArthur
 Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the VSBI in Victoria.
 The FFDI provides daily values of bushfire danger based on meterological
 data.
 However, this research used a seasonal perspective approach.
 Thus, it was necessary to compute seasonal metrics of fire weather based
 on the FFDI.
 There are two common seasonal metrics of this index.
 The first metric is a cumulative sum of daily FFDI values (FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cum
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The second metric is the number of days with FFDI values greater than an
 arbitrary threshold.
 For this investigation the chosen threshold was 25 (FFDI>25).
 Values above this threshold reflect days with very high to catastrophic
 bushfire danger.
 The data used for the analyses was time series of FFDI
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cum
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and FFDI>25 in Victoria.
 The period of the FFDI computation was 1920-2010.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the VSBI requires normalized climate data averaged—summed
 in the case of precipitation—for each variable.
 A time series of VSBI values was a third input of fire weather in the analyses.
 The methodology section presents a detailed descripion of the VSBI formulation.
 The analyses used climate data to compute seasonal fire weather indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computation of fire weather indices used daily values of climate variables.
 The calculations with weather station (WS) data used 3 pm records.
 This is the approximate time when the most sever fire weather conditions
 occur 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Six Victorian weather stations were selected for this analysis—shown in
 the appendix—.
 These stations provide the best available information for the computation
 of this index 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Seasonal fire weather in Victoria was also estimated using reanalysis data.
 Using the 20CR and HADISST data allowed to extend the calculations to the
 first half of the 20

 century.
 Climate data was also used to compute climate indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This investigation also explored the influence of several climate modes
 of variability over bushfires in Victoria.
 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indean Ocean Dipole (IOD) and
 Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are among the most important for this region
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gong1999,Williams2001,Cai2009,Risbey2009b,Ho2011,Ummenhofer2011,White2013"

\end_inset

.
 Seasonal weather composites suggested a strong influence of ENSO over bushfire
 occurrences in Victoria.
 Thus, the analysis has a higher emphasis over this driver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis used three ENSO indices, and one index for the IOD and SAM
 respectively.
 The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NINO3.4 and NINO1+2.
 The Dipole Mode Index (DMI) and Antartic Oscillation (AAO) revealed the
 relationships with IOD and SAM respectively.
 The analysis used climate indices data from several institutions: Australian
 Bureau of Meteorology (SOI), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
 (NINO3.4, AAO), Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (DMI).
 The climatologies used in the calculation of these indices were were 1951-2000
 (NINO3.4.), 1958-2010 (DMI), and 1979-2000 (AAO).
 The NINO1+2 index was computed using the HADISST data.
 The climatology for this index was 1911-2011

Bushfire and heatwave weather patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sub-section aims to reproduce the results of bushfire and heatwave
 weather patterns.
 It presents daily and seasonal composites using an alternative bushfire
 database.
 For this experiment, Risk Frontiers provided the bushfire records (RF).
 Additionally, the investigation used a second heatwave definition.
 Nairn et al.
 (2009) provide a detailed explanation of the heatwave definition employed.
 This sub-section starts presenting time series of fire activity and heatwaves.
 They are useful to understand the evolution of these two types of events.

 shows a time series of bushfire and heatwave events in Victoria during
 the period 1961-2010.
 Panel a) shows the evolution of extreme bushfire events in this region
 using the RF database.
 According to its records, there is no evident trend in the occurrence of
 bushfires during this period.
 As expected, they seem to peak during very strong negative phases of the
 Southern Oscillation Index (shown in blue lines).
 However, the long-term relationship shows a rather weak relationship (r=-0.33).
 On the other hand, panel b) displays a time series of the 55th percentile
 of heatwaves using Nairn et al.
 (2009) definition during the same period.
 The panel shows that extreme heatwaves occur less frequently than extreme
 fire events.
 Additionally, there is no correlation between the heatwave and SOI time
 series (r=-0.04).

 The computation only took into account fire records in Victoria.
 However, the hot anomalies influence several regions in Australia.
 It directly affects Victoria and Southern Australia; as well as sectors
 of West Australia, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the Bass
 Strait.
 During this day, Queensland and the coastal West Australia present cold
 anomalies.
 During the start day of the bushfires (day 0), a cold front reduces the
 hot anomalous region.
 A day after the cold front passage, warm anomalies are still present in
 Victoria, New South Wales and the Northen Territory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, heatwaves present persistent hot anomalies (+ 3 oC) during
 the three days.
 During day -1, heatwaves show perhaps even more intense anomalies than
 bushfires.
 The extent of the region affected by hot anomalies is also greater in compariso
n to bushfires.
 This area even includes the coastal area of West Australia.
 Heatwaves and bushfires present cold anomalies in Queensland a day before
 the start of the events.
 When heatwaves start (day 0), the hot anomalies remains without substantial
 change.
 In contrast, the cold anomalies in Queensland become slightly stronger.
 While the coastal region of West Australia starts presenting cold anomalies
 as well.
 During the second day of heatwaves (day +1), the hot anomalies continue
 constantly.
 However, there is a slight increase of cold anomalies in West Australia.

 A day before the start of bushfires, Victoria shows strong negative anomalies
 (-15%).
 In contrast, the coastal region of West Australia presents wet anomalies.
 When bushfires start (day 0), the cold front significantly reduces the
 area affected by dry anomalies.
 Although Victoria remains extremely dry.
 One day after bushfire were triggered, the cold front brings wet anomalies
 to most of Australia.
 However, Victoria and New South Wales still present dry anomalies (-5%).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The behaviour of relative humidity anomalies during heatwaves does not present
 significant changes.
 During day -1, strong negative anomalies (-15%) affect South Australia.
 Although, this dry pattern also influences Victoria.
 To a lesser extent this anomalies affect the rest of the continent.
 Weak wet anomalies surround the overall dry pattern.
 At day zero—when heatwaves start—, the dry anomalies concentrate in Southern
 Australia and Victoria.
 In contrast, the wet anomalies during this day become stronger.
 During the second day of the heatwaves, the synoptic pattern resembles
 substantially the pattern one day before.

Heatwaves also present a wave train pattern with more intense anomalies
 (positive and negative).
 However, it is interesting to notice how the Antartic region shows areas
 with negative anomalies.
 This result contrasts with the finding for the bushfires synoptic pattern.
 Overall, the synoptic pattern remains constant before and after the start

McArthur Forest Fire Danger computation (1974-2010)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of fire weather variability started with the computation of
 the FFDI.
 The computation used weather station data as well as an alternative reanalysis
 dataset (ERA-20C).
 The period of analysis was 1974-2010.
 Weather station data was only available for this period.
 The computed FFDI was analysed using probability density functions and
 time series.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probability-density-functions-FFDI"

\end_inset

 shows that the distributions of the FFDI computed reanalysis and weather
 station data are quite similar.
 The same procedure was applied to each FFDI.
 Additionally, the verifications also included comparissons including time
 series.
 These steps revealed that precipitation could be bias-corected.
 Bias-corrected precipitation data was later used to attempt an improvement
 of the FFDI results.
 However, after the bias-correcting this variable there were no improvements
 in the resutls as figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, panel a) of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 indicates that ERA-20C captures some precipitation's variability (r=0.49,p=0.00).
 Therefore, the precipitation values were bias-corrected using a multiplicative
 linear scaling factor of 3.08.
 This factor was the result of dividing the mean of the two time-series.
 As shown in panel b) of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the bias-correction reduced the values of the ERA-20C data.
 After the bias-correction, the precipitation values are of similar magnitude

 show the climate-bushfire relationships during spring for the period 1960-2009.
 The relationship between the climate variables shows physical consistency.
 As expected, they also show a strong correlation with the three fire weather
 metrics (VSBI, FFDIcum and FFDI>25).
 The VSBI is strongly correlated with FFDIcum (r=0.9,p<0.05) and moderately
 correlated with FFDI>25 (r=0.46,p<0.05).
 The climate indices (SST.1.2, SOI, NINO3.4 and DMI) show moderate and statisticall
y significant correlations with FFDIcum.
 The relationship climate indices and FFDI>25 is weak has no statistical
 significance.

 present the correlation coefficients for climate-bushfire relations for
 the period 1961-2010.
 The climate variables show strong and statistically significant relationships
 with fire weather metrics.
 The relationship between these variables and fire activity is moderate
 and statistically significant only for maximum temperature.
 This variable shows the moderate relationship with RF (r=0.47,p<0.05) and
 DELWP (r=0.39,p<0.05).
 Relative humidity shows statistical significance only with the RF database
 (r=-0.32,p<0.05).
 Additionally, the VSBI is strongly correlated with the two FFDI seasonal
 metrics.
 Moreover, it shows statistical significance with both fire activity records.
 On the other hand, the climate indices show weak correlations with fire
 weather and activity.
 SST1.2 and NINO3.4 show statistically significant relationships with fire
 activity and FFDI metrics.
 Although, their correlations are weak (0.28<r< 0.34).

 Panel a) shows the relationships between climate variables, fire weather
 and activity.
 On the other hand, panel b) shows the correlations using climate indices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panel a) shows that most variables have a weak to moderate forecasting skill.
 Most of the correlations are statistically significant.
 Relative humidity is the variable that shows the stronger skill.
 This variable presents correlations of -0.59 and -0.5 with FFDIcum and FFDI>25
 respectively.
 Additionally, the results with fire activity are consistent.
 RH shows a correlation of -0.64 and -0.44 with the RF and DELWP databases
 respectively.
 The VSBI shows similar results in comparison to RH.
 However, the strength of the correlations is slightly lower.
 The VSBI presents a correlation of 0.56 and 0.45 with FFDIcum and FFDI>25
 respectively.
 The VSBI correlations with fire activity are 0.63 for the RF database and
 0.42 for the DELWP records.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the results with climate indices show that they do not
 present a strong skill to forecast fire weather and activity.
 Most of the correlation are weak and are not statistically significant.
 The NINO3.4 index shows the strongest results.
 Although its correlations are weak (0.3<r<0.39) they all are statistically
 significant.
 The SST1+2 index shows a similar strength in its correlations in comparison
 to NINO3.4.
 Although, fewer correlations are statistically significant with this index.
