Climate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Victoria's climate is greatly influenced by its topography
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 The Great Dividing Range (GDR), has created three main climatic zones:
 Northern, Southern and Southeastern Victoria.
 In Northern Victoria, precipitation is influenced by northwesterly air
 masses.
 The north-west region of this climatic zone receives an annual average
 of 250 to 300 mm of precipitation and endures intense heatwaves; whereas,
 in the north-east the precense of mountains raises the precitation range
 to 800-1000 mm in a year.
 Precipitation in Southern Victoria also increases with altitude; however,
 westerly winds drive its formation.
 In contrast, variations in temperature in this zone are driven by northerly
 winds, which produce summers with average an temperature of 28 ºC and maxima
 of 43 ºC.
 In Southeastern Victoria, synoptic systems in the Tasman Sea influence
 its precipitation rate, especially in the eastern region that recieves
 in average 1000 mm in a year.
 The western region of Southeastern Victoria is less influenced by the Tasman
 Sea, and receives in average 600 mm of precipitation

\begin_layout Section
Bushfire weather
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meteorological variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfire weather is analyzed through variables such as wind, precipitation,
 air temperature, and relative humidity.
 The behaviour of this meteorological variables influences every aspect
 of bushfires, including their start, spread and intensity.
 Bushfires start if high temperatures, low levels of relative humidity and
 precipitation have dried vegetation to a flammable point.
 Winds also contribute in the ignition of bushfires by taking moisture content
 out of the vegetation and providing oxygen for combustion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, atmospheric instability favours the occurence of thunderstorms;
 which are a natural ignition source of bushfires 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 The spread of bushfires is controlled by winds, which propagate them and
 also can change their flank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 Atmospheric instability also contributes to the spread of these events
 because it produces spotting (spotfires).
 The intensity of bushfires is determined by the flammability and distribution
 of vegetation; which are controlled by precipitation in seasonal time scales

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Synoptics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meteorological variables of bushfire weather are governed by large-scale
 synoptic patterns that have particular characteristics in different regions
 of Australia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 However, the synoptic weather patterns associated with bushfires all have
 hot-dry air advection processes in common, and often the passage of cold
 fronts in initiated bushfire areas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 For example, bushfire weather in southeast Australia is characterized by
 an atmospheric high-pressure centre (“high”) in the Tasman Sea and a strong
 cold front arriving from the west

On the other hand, the passage of a cold front causes abrupt changes in
 wind direction converting bushfires in extreme or even catastrophic events.
 A strong 850-hPa temperature gradient (associated with cold front arrivals)
 is highly correlated with extreme bushfire events in Victoria 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 According to this study, “Ash Wednesday” was categorized as an unusually
 extreme event corresponding to the 0.1 % of registered bushfires in 40 years
 in this state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Climate modes of variability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the most important modes of climate variability for Australia are
 El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and
 the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009"

\end_inset

.
 Improving the capacity to predict extreme bushfire seasons will rely on
 understanding how they are influenced by these large-scale atmospheric
 circulation variations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO is associated with potentially dangerous bushfire weather in southeast
 and central Australia especially during El Niño events (characterised by
 positive SST anomalies in the central and equatorial Pacific Ocean); relative
 humidity, being the parameter most influenced by ENSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Williams1999"

\end_inset

.
 A positive phase of SAM (lower than normal pressures in the polar region)
 produces significant reductions in rainfall in southern Australia, including
 the south western tip of Werstern Australia, southern Victoria and Tasmania
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009"

\end_inset

; which might have an influence in preconditioning bushfires in these regions.
 In Victoria, positive IOD events (warmer SST anomalies in the Western Indian
 Ocean relative to the east) are correlated with higher maximum temperatures
 and lower precipitation in spring (September-October-November, SON), exacerbati
ng fuel loads dryness in the bushfire season (December-January-February,
 DJF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, it has been demonstrated for this region there exists a potential
 to develop a forecasting tool to predict bushfire seasons based on climate
 variables that have a moderate relationship with ENSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO has an important influence over bushfire regimes in several regions
 of the world (citations).
 For example, there is a link between El Nino events and decreased fire
 acitity in the Southern of the United States (citation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire weather is influenced by ENSO in several regions in Australia.
 This influence is exacervated in the Southeast when there is a superposition
 of the Interdecal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and ENSO (citation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Seasonal fire danger forecasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal forecasting uses statistical-empirical methods as well as dynamical
 models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 Statistical- empirical models describe the relationship between predictands
 and predictors usually assuming linear relationships.
 Common predictans are temperature and precipitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Pepler2015,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 Usual predictors are sea surface temperature, soil moisture, snow cover
 and sea ice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 One of the most common problems with this approach is multicollinearity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 This occurs when several predictors are variables in the forecast and they
 are correlated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamical forecasts rely on the physical modelation of the climate system.
 A simple model describes the interactions of the atmosphere only.
 In complex models, all the components of the system and their interactions
 take part.
 Setting initial conditions and insufficient knowledge of physical processes
 are common problems with them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamical models have in general better forecasting accuracy than statistical-em
pirical methods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, ensemble dynamical models perform better than a single model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pepler2015"

\end_inset

.
 Yet, sophisticated statistical methods can have an accuracy comparable
 to the dynamical counterparts
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013"

\end_inset

.
 In practise, decision-makers use a combination of statistical-empirical
 and dynamical approaches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variables that are usually forecasted are temperature and precipitation.
 The forecast for them is better for their mean values than the extremes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Pepler2015"

\end_inset

.
 However, seasonal bushfire weather forecasting requires also information
 about relative humidity and wind.
 The skill to forecast this variables is less developed

\begin_layout Standard
In Australia, there is a relationship between fire activity and ENSO.
 Tasmania exhibits more area burnt with decreased rainfall in the coincident
 summer season
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 Since ENSO is a major driver of Australian rainfall

 region.
 The Northern Territory exhibits a strong relationship between area burnt,
 rainfall and ENSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In Victoria, there is also potential to use ENSO indices for bushfire activity
 forecasting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

acknowledged that ENSO and fire activity could not have a link in other
 regions of the country.

\begin_layout Section
Data and methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment required bushfire events, climate and ENSO indices data.
 The bushfire datasets are those described in detail the previous chapter.
 This experiment also used weather station and reanalysis data in Victoria.
 The ENSO indices selected were the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Nino
 3.4.
 and Nino 1+2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire datasets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The criteria to define a bushfire event remains the same as in the previous
 chapter.
 A bushfire event in DELWP's dataset refers to any event that burnt more
 than 10.000 hectares.
 A bushfire event in 'Peril Aus' database is any major event reported in
 several locations in Victoria.
 With this definitions both databses are comparable, as demosntrated in
 the previous chapter.
 Every event was included for the season December-January-February for the
 period 1961-2011.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correlation between bushfire events and VSBI was examined.
 This allowed to investigate the potential of the index to forecast extreme
 bushfire seasons.
 The relationship between the VSBI components with bushfire activity was
 also explored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment used climate data to estimate seasonal bushfire potential
 in Victoria.
 The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), was used to estimate this
 potential.
 This index requires maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, wind
 speed, and precipitation daily data.
 For the first three variables the data was obtained at 3 pm.
 The Victorian weather stations selected were: Bendigo, Laverton, Melbourne
 Airport, Mildura, Nhill and Omeo.
 The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) provided this data which was available
 since 1971.
 This data was also used to estimate the Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index
 (VSBI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal bushfire potential in Victoria and the VSBI were also estimated
 using renalysis data.
 Using the 20CR and HADISST data allowed to extend the calculations back
 to 1961.
 From this year consistent bushfire occurences data was available.
 This allowed to establish the relationship between several variables.
 This variables were bushfire activity, seasonal bushfire potential, VSBI
 and ENSO indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ENSO indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This investigation explored the relationship between ENSO with weather variables
 associated with bushfire occurences.
 Three ENSO indices were used for this purpose.
 The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Nino 3.4 and Nino 1+2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SOI measures the sea surface presure differences between Tahiti and
 Darwin, Australia (citation).
 A negative value of the SOI represents below-average air presure in Tahiti.
 This also represents warm sea-surface temperature in the Tropical Pacific
 (El Nino phase).
 The opposite condition is true for a La Nina phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO phases can also be detected measuring sea-surface tempreature in the
 Trocpial Pacific Ocean.
 This measurements are taken in specific regions in the Tropical Pacific
 Ocean.
 The Nino 3.4 and Nino 1+2 represent two of this regions.
 A three-month sea surface temperature running mean above 0.5 oC defines
 a El Nino event.
 The same value with the opposite sign represent a La Nina event.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation of bushfire activity data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the two bushfire datasets available was necessary to confirm
 their consistency.
 DELWP's dataset associates bushfire events with area burnt.
 Therefore, a bushfire event definition for this dataset required to select
 an area burnt threshold.
 For this research, a threshold of 10.000 hectares was selected.
 This threshold allowed to compare DELWP's bushfire events with Risk Frontiers
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calculation of seasonal bushfire potential 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfire potential can be estimated using weather variables.
 Temperature, relative humidity, wind and precipitation are common variables
 used for this purpose.
 This variables can be combined in mathematical equations.
 This equations reflect vaiable's relationships in producing the conditions
 for bushfires to occur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equations are known are bushfire indices.
 The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is used in Australia.
 The index is represented as an equation (citation):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
This daily index was selected to evaluate seasonal bushfire potential in
 Victoria.
 A seasonal metric was necessary to test the skill of the VSBI to forecast
 bushfire danger.
 Two seasonal metrics of FFDI were used to perform this analysis.
 The first metric was a seasonal sum of daily FFDI values.
 The number of days that a FFDI exceed a value of 25 during the season was
 the second metric.
 In both cases the season consisdered was December-January-February.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of reanalysis and weather station data reveled the need for
 bias-correction.
 The approach used to bias-correct the reanalysis data was to apply linear
 scaling techniques.
 For maximum temperature and wind speed, additive and multiplicative linear
 scaling were applied.
 Multiplicative linear scaling was applied to specific humidity to recalculate
 relative humidity values.
 This required bias-corrected maximum temperature values.
 Precipitation was not bias-corrected.
 Probability density functions (PDFs) allowed to test the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Composite analysis of FFDI variables 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI was proposed as the aggregation of sub-indices.
 Each sub-index representes a normalized spatial average.
 This average represents the value of a fixed large-scale of the seasonal
 composites presented.
 The variables that presented the strongest anomalous areas were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1000-hPa air temperature (T) in the region (33S-36S; 145E-150E).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear correlations were performed for the VSBI -and it components- in the
 SON season, with bushfire metrics and ENSO indices corresponding to the
 DJF season.
 This allowed to test the skill of the index to forecast bushfire weather
 and acivity.
 The correlations were also performed with ENSO indices for the season SON,
 with VSBI and bushfire metrics corresponding to the DJF season.
 This allowed to evalute the influence of ENSO in the preceding season (SON)
 to the VSBI, and bushfire metrics in the DJF season.

 Therefore a rigorous validation of the information available was required.
 The two databases used (DELWP and PerilAUS) have information starting from
 1903.
 However the definitions of bushfire events for these databases are different.
 In order to compare these data, a burnt are threshold in the DELWP dataset
 was investigated.

Two period of analysis were defined.
 From 1911 to 1960 and 1961-2011.
 From 1911 meteorological information is more reliable in Victoria.
 The year 2011 was selected since the PerilAUs data was availabe until this
 year.
 The decision to split in half the period of analysis was also important.
 This was performed since the information was going to be compared with
 ENSO indices.
 It is known that the ENSO relationship changes over long periods of time

The results of this analysis are shown in table 4.2.
 DELWP's database shows clear a imbalance in bushfire events for any burnt
 area threshold.
 Thefore the second period was selected for all the analysis.
 A 10,000 Ha burnt are threshold yielded 47 bushfire events in DELWP's datset.
 For the same period 43 bushfire events were registered in PerilAUS database.

Extended FFDI record
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calcualtion of the FFDI was necesary to evaluate bushfire danger in
 Victoria.
 Especifically, how seasonal bushfire weather influences bushfire occurrences.
 Therefore seasonal metrics fo the FFDI were used.
 The sum of daily FFDI values for the DJF season represents a seasonal bushfire
 weather metric.
 A second metric used was the number of days above 25 FFDI value for the
 same season.
 The calcualtions were performed using weather stations data.
 Additionally, reanalys data was also used after a linear scaling bias-correctio
n.
 All the calculations presented in this section represent average values
 in Victoria.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows times series of seasonal FFDI in Victoria.
 Panel a) presents the results using a the first seaosnal metric (sum of
 daily values).
 Panel b) presents seasonal FFDI as the number of days with a FFDI value
 greater than 25.
 This calcualtions comprises the season DJF during the period 1972-2010.
 This period was selected because weather station data for FFDI variables
 is not available in Victoria before 1972.
 In both cases is evident that weather station data represent more extreme
 bushfire weather seasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This differeces are likely to occur for several reasons.
 FFDI variables from renalysis data do not correspond exactly to surface
 values.
 Reanalysis data is available from 1000 h-Pa level.
 The FFDI with weather station data is calcualted with values at 3 pm (citation).
 Yet, reanalysis data for FFDI variables is available on a 6-hourly basis.
 This limited the availability of data to 4 pm values.
 Finally, there are intricsinc limitations in the reanalsis dataset already
 discussed in section xxx.
 The results depict a similar variability.
 The R coefficient for panel a) was XXX and for panel b) XXX.
 However, on an interanual basis they differ on magnitude.
 Thefore a bias-correction of reanalysis data was required.
