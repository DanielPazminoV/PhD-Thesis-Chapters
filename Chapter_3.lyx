 Fire weather in southeastern Australia has a typical pattern.
 Over the Tasman Sea, a quasi-stationary anticyclone is present

 Its circulation advects hot and dry air from the interior of the continent

 These environmental conditions make vegetation prone to fire ignitions

 At the same time, a cyclone over the Southern Ocean supports the arrival
 of cold fronts to this region 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 These cold fronts can produce a catastrophic bushfire event because they
 change and extend the flank of the fire fronts

 Some of the investigations that describe this pattern focus on the catastrophic
 events

 performed an evaluation of the meteorological conditions of "Ash Wednesday".
 The author proposed the 850 hPa level horizontal temperature gradient as
 a parameter to assess fire weather.
 The cyclone-anticyclone dipole structure is the basis for this parameter.
 Extreme fires are more likely to occur when there are greater temperature
 differences between the cold front air mass and the hot column of air over
 southern Australia.
 Using this criterion, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 established that "Ash Wednesday" ranks in the 0.1% of events using 40 years
 of reanalysis data.
 On the other hand, reproducing the arrival of cold fronts is a key factor
 in forecasting extreme fire weather

 investigation also comprised a simulation that provided further insights
 on the wind structures that made “Ash Wednesday” catastrophic.
 It highlighted that not only the mobility of the frontal system created
 this extreme fire event, but also the depth of the trough system.
 In this study, the cold front arrival was simulated with a 1-hour lag.
 Over time, computer simulations of extreme fire events in this region have
 become more sophisticated.

 Their study focused on simulating with great detail the mesoscale phenomena.
 It reproduced the arrival of the cold front of that day with a 30 minutes
 lag compared to observations.
 The investigation also determined the spatial and temporal variability
 of fire danger.
 Using the results of the numerical model, the McArthur's Forest Fire Danger
 Index was computed

 The paper demonstrates how changes in temperature, humidity and wind influenced

 Several studies focus on a single case study to simulate and explain fire

 “Ash Wednesday” and "Black Saturday" are the most relevant cases regarding
 human fatalities and economic impact

, and therefore the focus of great research attention.
 Investigating single case fire weather studies has been useful to identify
 the main characteristics of these events.
 However, fire weather research with a long-term synoptic approach has been
 less common.

 provided further insights on fire weather patterns with a long-term approach.
 They investigated the role of Rossby waves and extreme fronts on fire weather.
 The analysis covered the period 1979-2010 and focused on southeastern Australia.
 The study used days with extreme cold fonts days to define extreme fire
 weather events.
 A surface temperature drop of a least of 17

 Identifying them proved to be useful in establishing fire weather days.

 argue that Rossby wave breaking produces a potential vorticity anomaly
 in this region.
 According to the author, this anomaly generates an anticyclone in the Tasman
 Sea that drives hot and dry air to southeastern Australia.

The circulation produced by an anticyclone in the Tasman Sea has also been

 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 claim that fire weather and heatwave conditions are usually different.
 On one hand, this study argues that cold fronts are the defining feature
 of fire weather.
 On the other hand, several studies mention that fire and heatwaves are
 related events without providing evidence or further references 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Therefore, the especific characteristics that distinguish them and their
 interactions remain unexplored.
 Investigating this relationship demands to review some relevant heatwave
 literature.

 The period of analysis was 1979-2008.
 The investigation used an automatic tracking scheme 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, to investigate the trajectories of the cyclones and anticyclones.
 The study determined that an anticyclone in the Tasman Sea produces heatwave
 conditions in southeastern Australia advecting hot and dry air to the interior
 of the continent.
 Other studies concur with this mechanism 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

, a wave train amplification that starts in the Indian Ocean creates the
 anticyclone.

In contrast to fire weather research, the investigation of heatwaves in
 this region has considered the interactions with other extreme events.

 examined the large-scale connections between heatwaves in Victoria and
 extreme rainfall events in Queensland.
 The co-occurrence of these events motivated this study.
 However, this reasecrh found that there is no dynamic link between them.
 Tropical convection drives extreme rainfall events in Queensland.
 This convection usually occurs during strong “La Nina” events.
 On the other hand, heatwaves in Victoria are locally driven by the mechanisms
 described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In contrast,

 found that tropical cyclone outflow reinforces the potencial vorticity
 of the antyclone that produces heatwave conditions in this region.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 investigations undertake the synoptic climatology approach that seems less
 explored in fire weather research.
 It appears that a lack of robust fire activity records hampers these type
 of studies.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 used the 850 hPa horizontal temperature gradient before the cold front
 arrival.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 used the temperature difference after the passage of the cold front.
 In both cases, they validated they approaches with fire activity dates
 published in the scientific literature.
 These dates are scarce.
 Therefore, the logical behind their approaches is sound.
 Eventhough the oficial bushfire database of the Victorian Government has
 not been peer-reviewed, it has been used in other fire investigations

 Therefore, it could be useful to investigate long-term fire weather patterns.
 Additionally, extending the synoptic climatology of heatwaves is another
 reasearch task that could be undertaken.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This hampers the ability to reach conclusions about trends.

Fire weather forecasting and climate modes of variability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the investigations have focused on the sub-regional processes
 that drive fire weather.
 However, climate modes of variability exert a significant influence on
 weather—and fire weather—in Australia.
 For example, “El Nino” events generally bring dry conditions to Australia
 (Risbey, 2009).
 On the other, hand wet conditions are usually linked to a “La Nina” events.
 Moreover, the Indian Ocean dynamics has contributed to several droughts
 in southeastern Australia (citations).
 In fact, positive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole produce hot and dry
 conditions during in spring in Victoria.
 These environmental conditions contribute to the availability of fuels
 and an increase in extreme fire events in this region (Cai, 2009).
 A large-scale analysis of the weather patterns associated with fire activity
 in this region could offer further insights to disentangle the influences
 of these climate modes of variability over fire weather.
 To accomplish this, a long-term analysis of fire weather is again necessary.
 A synoptic climatology of fire weather could contribute to having greater
 confidence in the global patterns that drive fire weather in this region.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploring the synoptic climate signal based on a long-term analysis could
 contribute to extending the lead time of the forecasts.
 Addtionally, a synoptic climatology could contribute to better understand
 the mechanisms that drive fire weather.
