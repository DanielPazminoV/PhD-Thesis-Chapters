Fire weather synoptic patterns 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Synoptic patterns help us understand how the climate system drives meteorologica
l events.
 Fire weather in southeastern Australia has a typical pattern.
 Over the Tasman Sea, a quasi-stationary anticyclone is present.
 Its circulation advects hot and dry air from the interior of the continent.
 These environmental conditions make vegetation prone to fire ignitions.
 At the same time, a cyclone over the Southern Ocean supports the arrival
 of cold fronts to this region.
 These cold fronts can turn a “bad” fire weather day into a catastrophic
 event.
 They change and extending the flank of the fire fronts (citations).
 Several fire weather studies describe this pattern (citations).
 Most investigations focus on the catastrophic events (citations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mills (2005) performed an evaluation of the meteorological conditions of
 "Ash Wednesday".
 Mills (2005) proposed a parameter to assess and predict fire weather.
 The study used the 850 hPa level horizontal temperature gradient.
 The cyclone-anticyclone dipole structure is the basis for this parameter.
 Extreme fires are more likely to occur when there are greater temperature
 differences between the cold front air mass and the hot column of air over
 southern Australia.
 Using this criterion, Mills (2005) established that "Ash Wednesday" ranks
 in the 0.1% of events using 40 years of reanalysis data.
 On the other hand, reproducing the arrival of cold fronts is the key factor
 in forecasting extreme fire weather (citations).
 Mills (2005) investigation also comprised a simulation that provided further
 insights on the wind structures that made “Ash Wednesday” catastrophic.
 It highlighted that not only the mobility of the frontal system created
 this extreme fire event, but also the depth of the trough system.
 In this study, the cold front arrival was simulated with a 1-hour lag.
 Over time, computer simulations of extreme fire events in this region have
 become more sophisticated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Engels et al.
 (2012) simulated the meteorological conditions of "Black Saturday".
 Their study focused on simulating with great detail the mesoscale phenomena.
 It reproduced the arrival of the cold front of that day with a 30 minutes
 lag compared to observations.
 The investigation also determined the spatial and temporal variability
 of fire danger.
 Using the results of the numerical model, the McArthur's Forest Fire Danger
 Index was computed (Noble et al., 1980).
 The paper demonstrates how changes in temperature, humidity and wind influenced
 the spatial and temporal variability of fire danger on "Black Saturday".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mills (2005) and Engels et al.
 (2012) are examples of a typical approach to examine fire weather in this
 region.
 Several studies focus on a single case study to simulate and explain fire
 weather behavior (citations).
 “Ash Wednesday” and "Black Saturday" are the most relevant cases regarding
 human fatalities and economic impact (citations), and therefore the focus
 of great research attention.
 Investigating single case fire weather studies has been useful to identify
 the main characteristics of these events.
 However, fire weather research with a long-term synoptic approach has been
 less common.
 Exploring the synoptic climate signal based on a long-term analysis could
 contribute to extending the lead time of the forecasts.
 Addtionally, a synoptic climatology could contribute to better understand
 the mechanisms that drive fire weather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reeder et at.
 (2015) provided further insights on fire weather patterns with a long-term
 approach.
 They investigated the role of Rossby waves and extreme fronts on fire weather.
 The analysis covered the period 1979-2010 and focused on southeastern Australia.
 The study used days with extreme cold fonts days to define extreme fire
 weather events.

C ) after the passage of the cold front defined extreme cold fronts.
 Identifying extreme cold fronts proved to be useful in establishing fire
 weather days.
 Reeder et at.
 (2015) attributed an anticyclone in the Tasman Sea as the driver of hot
 and dry air to southeastern Australia.
 The amplification of a Rossby wave that eventually overturns produces this
 anticyclone.
 The Rossby wave breaking produces a potential vorticity anomaly in this
 region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism has also been attributed to the occurrence of heatwaves (citation
s).
 However, Reeder et at.
 (2015) argue that fire weather and heatwave conditions are usually different.
 This study only mentions that cold fronts are the defining feature of fire
 weather.
 Other studies also mention that fire and heatwaves are related events without
 providing further details (citations).
 It would be interesting to explore the differences between these two types
 of events.
 Our ability to predict these events could benefit from an understanding
 of the characteristics that distinguish them.
 The interactions between them also remain unexplored.
 Therefore, to investigate this relationship, it is also important to review
 the heatwave literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pezza et al.
 (2012) investigated the synoptic climatology of heatwaves in southern Australia.
 This study provided an original heatwave definition.
 Three consecutive days with maximum temperature above the 90

 percentile define a heatwave.
 The criteria included the lack of relief during the nights.
 The minimum temperature on the second and third days should also be above
 the 90

 percentile.
 The definition required using a monthly climatology.
 The period of analysis was 1979-2008.
 The investigation used an automatic tracking scheme (citations).
 With this system, the Pezza et al.
 (2012) investigated the trajectories of the cyclones and anticyclones.
 The study determined that a high in the Tasman Sea produces heatwave conditions
 in southeastern Australia.
 A wave train amplification that starts in the Indian Ocean creates the
 anticyclone.
 In contrast to fire weather research, the investigation of heatwaves has
 considered the interactions or co-occurrences with other extreme events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boschat et al.
 (2014) examined the large-scale connections between heatwaves in Victoria
 and extreme rainfall events in Queensland.
 The co-occurrence of these events motivated this study.
 However, this study found that there is no dynamic link between heatwaves
 extreme rainfall events in Victoria and Queensland respectively.
 Tropical convection drives extreme rainfall events in Queensland.
 This convention usually occurs during strong “La Nina” events.
 On the other hand, heatwaves in Victoria are locally driven.
 An anticyclone produced by a wave train amplification that starts in the
 in the Indian Ocean generates heatwaves.
 Boschat et al.
 (2014) acknowledge that this anticyclone pattern is also present during
 extreme rainfall events in southern Queensland.
 However, the air parcel tracking allowed to determine that a different
 process forms this anticyclone.
 The high pressure system forms as part of a tropical-ex-tropical influence
 of "La Nina" events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pezza et al.
 (2012) and Boschat et al.
 (2014) investigations undertake the synoptic climatology approach that
 seems less explored in fire weather.
 It appears that a lack of robust fire activity records hampers these studies.
 For example, Mills (2005) and Reeder et al.
 (2015) rely first on weather parameters to identify extreme fire days.
 Mills (2005) used the 850 hPa horizontal temperature gradient before the
 cold front arrival.
 On the other hand, Reeder et al.
 (2015) used the temperature difference after the passage of the cold front.
 In both cases, they validated they approaches with the available fire activity
 dates.
 These dates are scarce in the scientific literature.
 Therefore, the logical behind their approaches is sound.
 Oficial bushfire records of the Victorian Government have not been peer-reviewe
d.
 However, they have been used in other fire investigations (Harris 2013).
 Therefore, they could be useful to investigate long-term fire weather patterns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maximum and minimum temperature are the basic variables to compute heatwaves.
 Long-term and high-quality records of these variables span the entire the
 entire 20th century.
 For example, the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network - Surface
 Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) dataset (citation).
 Therefore, the feasibility to perform long-term analysis increases.
 Despite this, the long-term analysis of heatwaves only starts on the nineteen-s
eventies.
 For example, Pezza et al.
 (2012) acknowledge that their study period is not long enough to establish
 significant trends.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the investigations have focused on the sub-regional processes
 that drive fire weather.
 However, climate modes of variability exert a significant influence on
 weather—and fire weather—in Australia.
 For example, “El Nino” events generally bring dry conditions to Australia
 (Risbey, 2009).
 On the other, hand wet conditions are usually linked to a “La Nina” events.
 Moreover, the Indian Ocean dynamics has contributed to several droughts
 in southeastern Australia (citations).
 In fact, positive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole produce hot and dry
 conditions during in spring in Victoria.
 These environmental conditions contribute to the availability of fuels
 and an increase in extreme fire events in this region (Cai, 2009).
 A large-scale analysis of the weather patterns associated with fire activity
 in this region could offer further insights to disentangle the influences
 of these climate modes of variability over fire weather.
 To accomplish this, a long-term analysis of fire weather is again necessary.
 A synoptic climatology of fire weather could contribute to having greater
 confidence in the global patterns that drive fire weather in this region.
