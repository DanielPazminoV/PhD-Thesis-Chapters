Meteorological variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfire weather is analyzed through variables such as wind, precipitation,
 air temperature, and relative humidity.
 The behaviour of this meteorological variables influences every aspect
 of bushfires, including their start, spread and intensity.
 Bushfires start if high temperatures, low levels of relative humidity and
 precipitation have dried vegetation to a flammable point.
 Winds also contribute in the ignition of bushfires by taking moisture content
 out of the vegetation and providing oxygen for combustion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, atmospheric instability favours the occurence of thunderstorms;
 which are a natural ignition source of bushfires 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 The spread of bushfires is controlled by winds, which propagate them and
 also can change their flank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 Atmospheric instability also contributes to the spread of these events
 because it produces spotting (spotfires).
 The intensity of bushfires is determined by the flammability and distribution
 of vegetation; which are controlled by precipitation in seasonal time scales

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Synoptics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meteorological variables of bushfire weather are governed by large-scale
 synoptic patterns that have particular characteristics in different regions
 of Australia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 However, the synoptic weather patterns associated with bushfires all have
 hot-dry air advection processes in common, and often the passage of cold
 fronts in initiated bushfire areas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 For example, bushfire weather in southeast Australia is characterized by
 an atmospheric high-pressure centre (“high”) in the Tasman Sea and a strong
 cold front arriving from the west

On the other hand, the passage of a cold front causes abrupt changes in
 wind direction converting bushfires in extreme or even catastrophic events.
 A strong 850-hPa temperature gradient (associated with cold front arrivals)
 is highly correlated with extreme bushfire events in Victoria 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 According to this study, “Ash Wednesday” was categorized as an unusually
 extreme event corresponding to the 0.1 % of registered bushfires in 40 years
 in this state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate modes of variability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the most important modes of climate variability for Australia are
 El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and
 the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009"

\end_inset

.
 Improving the capacity to predict extreme bushfire seasons will rely on
 understanding how they are influenced by these large-scale atmospheric
 circulation variations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO is associated with potentially dangerous bushfire weather in southeast
 and central Australia especially during El Niño events (characterised by
 positive SST anomalies in the central and equatorial Pacific Ocean); relative
 humidity, being the parameter most influenced by ENSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Williams1999"

\end_inset

.
 A positive phase of SAM (lower than normal pressures in the polar region)
 produces significant reductions in rainfall in southern Australia, including
 the south western tip of Werstern Australia, southern Victoria and Tasmania
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Risbey2009"

\end_inset

; which might have an influence in preconditioning bushfires in these regions.
 In Victoria, positive IOD events (warmer SST anomalies in the Western Indian
 Ocean relative to the east) are correlated with higher maximum temperatures
 and lower precipitation in spring (September-October-November, SON), exacerbati
ng fuel loads dryness in the bushfire season (December-January-February,
 DJF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cai2009"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, it has been demonstrated for this region there exists a potential
 to develop a forecasting tool to predict bushfire seasons based on climate
 variables that have a moderate relationship with ENSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO has an important influence over bushfire regimes in several regions
 of the world (citations).
 For example, there is a link between El Nino events and decreased fire
 acitity in the Southern of the United States (citation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire weather is influenced by ENSO in several regions in Australia.
 This influence is exacervated in the southeast when there is a superposition
 of the Interdecal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and ENSO (citation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Seasonal fire danger forecasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal forecasting uses statistical-empirical methods as well as dynamical
 models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 Statistical- empirical models describe the relationship between predictands
 and predictors usually assuming linear relationships.
 Common predictans are temperature and precipitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Pepler2015,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 Usual predictors are sea surface temperature, soil moisture, snow cover
 and sea ice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 One of the most common problems with this approach is multicollinearity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Troccoli2005"

\end_inset

.
 This occurs when several predictors are variables in the forecast and they
 are correlated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamical forecasts rely on the physical modelation of the climate system.
 A simple model describes the interactions of the atmosphere only.
 In complex models, all the components of the system and their interactions
 take part.
 Setting initial conditions and insufficient knowledge of physical processes
 are common problems with them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamical models have in general better forecasting accuracy than statistical-em
pirical methods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, ensemble dynamical models perform better than a single model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pepler2015"

\end_inset

.
 Yet, sophisticated statistical methods can have an accuracy comparable
 to the dynamical counterparts
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013"

\end_inset

.
 In practise, decision-makers use a combination of statistical-empirical
 and dynamical approaches

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variables that are usually forecasted are temperature and precipitation.
 The forecast for them is better for their mean values than the extremes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Doblas-Reyes2013,Pepler2015"

\end_inset

.
 However, seasonal bushfire weather forecasting requires also information
 about relative humidity and wind.
 The skill to forecast this variables is less developed

acknowledged that ENSO and fire activity could not have a link in other
 regions of the country.

\begin_layout Section
Data and methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment required bushfire events, climate and ENSO indices data.
 The bushfire datasets are those described in detail the previous chapter.
 This experiment also used weather station and reanalysis data in Victoria.
 The ENSO indices selected were the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Nino
 3.4.
 and Nino 1+2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bushfire datasets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The criteria to define a bushfire event remains the same as in the previous
 chapter.
 A bushfire event in DELWP's dataset refers to any event that burnt more
 than 10.000 hectares.
 A bushfire event in 'Peril Aus' database is any major event reported in
 several locations in Victoria.
 With this definitions both databses are comparable, as demosntrated in
 the previous chapter.
 Every event was included for the season December-January-February for the
 period 1961-2011.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correlation between bushfire events and VSBI was examined.
 This allowed to investigate the potential of the index to forecast extreme
 bushfire seasons.
 The relationship between the VSBI components with bushfire activity was
 also explored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Climate data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment used climate data to estimate seasonal bushfire potential
 in Victoria.
 The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), was used to estimate this
 potential.
 This index requires maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, wind
 speed, and precipitation daily data.
 For the first three variables the data was obtained at 3 pm.
 The Victorian weather stations selected were: Bendigo, Laverton, Melbourne
 Airport, Mildura, Nhill and Omeo.
 The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) provided this data which was available
 since 1971.
 This data was also used to estimate the Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index
 (VSBI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonal bushfire potential in Victoria and the VSBI were also estimated
 using renalysis data.
 Using the 20CR and HADISST data allowed to extend the calculations back
 to 1961.
 From this year consistent bushfire occurences data was available.
 This allowed to establish the relationship between several variables.
 This variables were bushfire activity, seasonal bushfire potential, VSBI
 and ENSO indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ENSO indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This investigation explored the relationship between ENSO with weather variables
 associated with bushfire occurences.
 Three ENSO indices were used for this purpose.
 The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Nino 3.4 and Nino 1+2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SOI measures the sea surface presure differences between Tahiti and
 Darwin, Australia (citation).
 A negative value of the SOI represents below-average air presure in Tahiti.
 This also represents warm sea-surface temperature in the Tropical Pacific
 (El Nino phase).
 The opposite condition is true for a La Nina phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ENSO phases can also be detected measuring sea-surface tempreature in the
 Trocpial Pacific Ocean.
 This measurements are taken in specific regions in the Tropical Pacific
 Ocean.
 The Nino 3.4 and Nino 1+2 represent two of this regions.
 A three-month sea surface temperature running mean above 0.5 oC defines
 a El Nino event.
 The same value with the opposite sign represent a La Nina event.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation of bushfire activity data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the two bushfire datasets available was necessary to confirm
 their consistency.
 DELWP's dataset associates bushfire events with area burnt.
 Therefore, a bushfire event definition for this dataset required to select
 an area burnt threshold.
 For this research, a threshold of 10.000 hectares was selected.
 This threshold allowed to compare DELWP's bushfire events with Risk Frontiers
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calculation of seasonal bushfire potential 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfire potential can be estimated using weather variables.
 Temperature, relative humidity, wind and precipitation are common variables
 used for this purpose.
 This variables can be combined in mathematical equations.
 This equations reflect vaiable's relationships in producing the conditions
 for bushfires to occur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equations are known are bushfire indices.
 The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is used in Australia.
 The index is represented as an equation (citation):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This daily index was selected to evaluate seasonal bushfire potential in
 Victoria.
 A seasonal metric was necessary to test the skill of the VSBI to forecast
 bushfire danger.
 Two seasonal metrics of FFDI were used to perform this analysis.
 The first metric was a seasonal sum of daily FFDI values.
 The number of days that a FFDI exceed a value of 25 during the season was
 the second metric.
 In both cases the season consisdered was December-January-February.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of reanalysis and weather station data reveled the need for
 bias-correction.
 The approach used to bias-correct the reanalysis data was to apply linear
 scaling techniques.
 For maximum temperature and wind speed, additive and multiplicative linear
 scaling were applied.
 Multiplicative linear scaling was applied to specific humidity to recalculate
 relative humidity values.
 This required bias-corrected maximum temperature values.
 Precipitation was not bias-corrected.
 Probability density functions (PDFs) allowed to test the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Composite analysis of FFDI variables 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI was proposed as the aggregation of sub-indices.
 Each sub-index representes a normalized spatial average.
 This average represents the value of a fixed large-scale of the seasonal
 composites presented.
 The variables that presented the strongest anomalous areas were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1000-hPa air temperature (T) in the region (33S-36S; 145E-150E).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1000-hPa relative humidity (Rhum) in the region (33S-36S; 145E-150E).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
300-hPa zonal wind (Uwnd) in the region (38S-48S; 125E-150E).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The season selected to perform the calculations for the index was September-Octo
ber-November (SON).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Linear corelations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear correlations were performed for the VSBI -and it components- in the
 SON season, with bushfire metrics and ENSO indices corresponding to the
 DJF season.
 This allowed to test the skill of the index to forecast bushfire weather
 and acivity.
 The correlations were also performed with ENSO indices for the season SON,
 with VSBI and bushfire metrics corresponding to the DJF season.
 This allowed to evalute the influence of ENSO in the preceding season (SON)
 to the VSBI, and bushfire metrics in the DJF season.
\end_layout

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extended FFDI record
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calcualtion of the FFDI was necesary to explore seasonal bushfire weather
 in Victoria.
 Especifically, the relationship between climate modes of variability, bushfire
 weather and bushfire occurrences.
 Therefore seasonal metrics fo the FFDI were used.
 The sum of daily FFDI values for the DJF season represents a seasonal bushfire
 weather metric.
 A second metric used was the number of days with a FFDI greater than 25
 for the same season.
 The calcualtions were performed using weather station data.
 Additionally, reanalysis data was also used after a linear scaling bias-correct
ion.
 All the calculations presented in this section represent average values
 in Victoria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FFDI calculated with weather station data demonstrated to represent Victoria
 with more extreme bushfire weather compared to the results using reanalysis
 data.
 This difference is likely to occur for several reasons.
 FFDI variables from renalysis data do not correspond exactly to surface
 values.
 Reanalysis data is available from 1000 h-Pa level.
 The FFDI with weather station data is calcualted with values at 3 pm.
 Yet, reanalysis data for FFDI variables is available on a 6-hourly basis.
 This limited the availability of data to 4 pm values.
 Finally, there are intricsinc limitations in the reanalysis dataset already
 discussed in Chapter 2.
 Yet, simple linear scaling tecniques demonstrated to adjust the biases
 without signifincatly altering the correlations.
 The bias-correction of each variable will be examined in this section.

shows two times series of seasonal FFDI in Victoria.
 Panel a) presents the results using the first seasonal metric (cummulative
 FFDI).
 Panel b) presents seasonal FFDI as the number of days with a FFDI value
 greater than 25.
 These calcualtions comprise the season DJF during the period 1974-2010.
 This period was selected because weather station data for every FFDI variable
 is not available in Victoria before 1974.
 Weather station data was necessary to bias-correct the FFDI results calculated
 with reanalysisd data.
 Weather station data represent Victoria with more extreme bushfire weather
 seasons compared to the original (without bias-correction) results with
 reanalysis data.
 In spite of this, the results depict a similar variability for the seasonal
 FFDI metrics.

 The maximum temperature show a deviation from the mean that is equivalent
 to 2.36 oC.
 Therefore a additive linear scaling was applied to the reanalysis data.

A final step in the FFDI calculation process was to extend the resutls using
 the reanalysis data further back in time.
 To perform this calculation the day with the highest precipitation was
 serch in the reanalysis for this region.
 This allowed to set the soil moisture deficit index to zero to start the
 calculations.
 The date was the 22th of september of 1918 with 62.06 mm.
 Thefore the results were extended for the period 1920-2010.

 In this analysis, VSBI was caculated using the reanalysis data, with the
 exception of the precipitation variable.
 Precipitation in the reanalysis data didn't represent accurately climate
 in Victoria.
 The formulation of the VSBI makes it extremely sensitive to this fact (which
 is not the case for FFDI results).
 Thefore weather station data for precipitation was used to calculate Victorian

Relationship between forecasting variables in spring (SON)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correlations for the spring season (SON) demonstrated to be physically
 consistent.
 For example, temperature was negativelly correlated with relative humidity
 and precipitation.
 Additionally, relative humidity was positively correlated with precipitation.
 These correlations were moderate to strong and statistically singnificat
 at the 5% level.
 This provided confidence that the rest of the correlations would reveal
 accurate insights about the relationship with the other variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI showed to be significantly correlated at the 5% level with the
 climate variables and with El Nino indices.
 This is an expected result that provided confidence of the correlations
 with the other variables.
 The VSBI in this season didn't show any correlation with the AAO index.
 However, it presented a strong, positive and statistically significant
 relationship with DMI.
 These relationship is stronger than the relationship with El Nino indices.
 Additionally, the VSBI is strongly correlated with the two metrics of FFDI,
 although the correlation is higher for FFDI(cum).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Correlations between El Nino indices also presented expected results.
 SST1.2 was negativelly correlated with SOI and positively correlated with
 NINO3.4.
 SOI was negativelly correlated with NINO3.4.
 Among these indices, NINO3.4, presented more statistically singificant results
 with the rest of the variables in comparision to other El Nino indices.
 The DMI index presented moderate to strong correlations with every variable,
 except with the AAO.
 The AAO index only presented a statistically significant (negative) correlation
 with temperature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seasonal metrics of FFDI demonstrated the expected correlations with
 climate variables.
 A high correlation was also found between the two metrics used.
 Since the physical relationship was sound, we can expect that the correlations
 with the climate modes of variablity are correct.
 For this season, the number of days with FFDI greater than 25 showed more
 statistically significant correlations with climate modes of variability
 than the cumulative FFDI.
 Especifically, NINO3.4 and DMI are correlated with FFDI>25, wihc is not
 the case for the FFDI(cum).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results were consistent for weather station as well as reanalysis
 data for every period analysed.
 The only exception was the correlations for the FFDI>25 variable.
 This variable showed less statistically singnificant results using reanalysis
 data, compared to the resutls using station data.

 accurate insights about the relationship with the other variables.

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI does not show statistically singnificant relationships with climate
 modes of variability in the DJF season.
 The only statisticaly significant relationship is with SST1.2.
 However, this index is part of the VSBI.
 On th other hand, the VSBI show moderate and statisticaly significant results
 with the FFDI seasonal metrics.
 This moderate relationship is slightly better for FFDI>25.
 The correlations of VSBI and fire activity are even higher than those for
 bushfire weather.
 The index shows a stronger relationship with Risk Frontiers bushfire database
 in comparisson to the DEPWL dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
El Nino indices show a strong relationship among them and a moderate relationshi
p with AAO and DMI.
 Overall, climate modes of variability do not show a a relationship with
 bushfire weather or activity in this season.
 The exceptions to this were the moderate and statistically significant
 correlations between El Nino indices and Risk Frontiers fire activity records.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seasonal metrics of FFDI show moderate and statistically significat
 correlations with fire activity in this season.
 Maximun temperature was the variable that show the most robust relationship
 with these metrics for the DJF season, being moderately correlated with
 both.
 Both metrics were strongly correlated with each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire activity records have stronger correlations with VSBI than FFDI int
 his season.
 Among the cliamte varaibles, maximum temperatuer and relative humidity
 showed the hoest correlations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results were consistent for weather station as well as reanalysis
 data for every period analysed.
 The only exception was the correlations for the FFDI>25 variable.
 This variable showed less statistically singnificant results using reanalysis
 data, compared to the resutls using station data.

Relationship between forecasting variables from spring to summer (SON-DJF)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VSBI in spring shows a moderate and statistically significant correlation
 with seasonal metrics of the FFDI in summer.
 The skill is higher with VSBI in the summer season.
 the VSBI has strong and statisticaly significant relationship with the
 two bushfire datasets used.
 The index has also a moderate relationship with ENSO indices and the DMI
 index.
 However, it has no relationship with the AAO index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the climate modes of variability indices show moderate to strong
 statistically significant correlations among them.
 For exmaple, ENSO indices in spring show skill to forecast how this indices
 will behave in the summer season.
 This is also tru for the DMI index.
 The AAO didn't show this skill.
 Climate indices didn't show on their own much ability to forecast bushfire
 weather or activity.
 However, the NINO3.4 did show moderate skill to predict bushfire activity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seasonal metrics of FFDI have a moderate skill to forecast bushfire
 weather meaured as VSBI in the summer seaosn.
 Although, the skill is higher is the same metric (FFDI) is used for summer.
 The correlation between FFDI in spring and fire activity is moderate and
 statistically significant.
 Although, this relationship is weaker than the relationship between VSBI
 in spring and fire activity in summer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results were consistent for weather station as well as reanalysis
 data for every period analysed.
 The only exception was the correlations for the FFDI>25 variable.
 This variable showed less statistically singnificant results using reanalysis
 data, compared to the resutls using station data.
 Additionally, the predictive skill of VSBI and FFDI is almost the same
 using reanalysis data.
 This contrasts with the results using weather station data; in which VSBI
 showed a slightly better skill.
