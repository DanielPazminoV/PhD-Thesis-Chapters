Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfires are a natural hazard of great concern for Australia because of
 their destructive power.
 In support of this statement it is worth prioritising the human fatalities
 over the property losses caused by bushfires.
 Taking into consideration the past 100 years, bushfires endangering human
 life have been categorized as the fourth most hazardous natural phenomena
 for people in Australia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 According to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and the Victorian Bushfires
 Royal Commission (VBRC), catastrophic bushfire events like “Ash Wednesday”
 (16 February 1983) and “Black Saturday” (7 February 2009) had lethal outcomes
 yielding 75 and 173 fatalities respectively

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, bushfire events have also had important consequences
 for the Australian economy.
 Considering only building losses, bushfires are the third most destructive
 natural hazard, being responsible for 20% of property losses, and are only
 preceded by cyclones (30%) and floods (approximately 22%) during the period
 1900 to 2003

 also established that “Ash Wednesday” ranked sixth among a list of the
 “top ten” most costly natural hazard events for insurance companies, adding
 up a sum of $1.63 billion (present value for the year 2006).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This outlook could become even more complicated in the future.
 In a world where the increasing trend in CO2 emissions is contributing
 to global warming 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stocker2013"

\end_inset

, it has been demonstrated that Australia is sensitive to this change and
 could increase its number of days of very high and extreme fire danger
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Williams2001"

\end_inset

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lucas2007"

\end_inset

 estimated that the number of

extreme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bushfire days in southeast Australia by 2050 would increase from 5-25%
 to 100-300% for low and high CO2 emission scenarios respectively.
 For the same region, not only is a higher bushfire risk potential expected,
 but also there is evidence suggesting that future bushfires seasons could
 start earlier and be more prolonged

\begin_layout Standard
Within Australia, the State of Victoria is one the most bushfire prone and
 vulnerable regions.
 Half of the economic impact associated with bushfires over the last 150
 years in Australia has occurred in Victoria 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Luke1978"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, it has endured some of the most catastrophic bushfire events
 in Australian history (e.g.
 “Black Friday” 1939, “Ash Wednesday” 1983, “Black Saturday” 2009).
 Climate projections also suggest that Victoria’s fire danger risk will
 increase, a trend not found for every region in Australia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clarke2011"

\end_inset

.
 Considering these facts, Victoria is a region where preparedness for bushfire
 seasons is of utmost importance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Planning to adequately respond to bushfire seasons requires an anticipated
 estimation of the potential risk.
 To accomplish this aim, a scheme for the calculation of the risk with months
 in advance is necessary, which has not been yet developed in Australia
 or the world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quantitative approach to calculate bushfire risk is the use of daily bushfire
 indices.
 This type of indices measure fire potential for the current day usually
 incorporating meteorological data (temperature, wind, relative humidity
 and precipitation) and soil moisture conditions (an indirect measure of
 fuel dryness) in a physical model -represented by mathematical equations-
 to yield a number within a scale that categorizes the risk.
 The effectiveness of bushfire indices to estimate risk in extreme conditions
 has been recently questioned in Australia.
 According to the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission (VBRC), which was
 established in 2009 to investigate the “Black Saturday” bushfires, the
 McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) -which is the most commonly used
 bushfire index in Australia- failed to represent the specific extreme nature
 of this event 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "VBRC1993"

\end_inset

.
 The VBRC has stated that the FFDI index should be revised in order to have
 numbers and language appropriate for this type of event or perhaps even
 a new index would be required
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "VBRC1993"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering these facts, Australia would greatly benefit from a quantitative
 forecasting tool to predict bushfire potential on a seasonal basis.
 In fact, to date there is no quantitative seasonal bushfire scheme operationall
y recognised in the world as an indicator of the overall season’s likelihood
 of significant fire activity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the state of Victoria in Australia uses a qualitative approach
 to make seasonal bushfire forecasts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
 These forecasts are based on antecedent conditions of maximum temperature,
 soil moisture, vegetation density and the phase of climate modes of varaibility
 such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
 Additionally, the estimation is also complemented with the outlook of climate
 variables such as maximun and minimum temperature as well as precipitation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Harris2013"

\end_inset

, this seasonal forecast could be improved using a more rigourous statistical
 aproach.
 Worldwide, the application of statistical seasonal forecasting schemes
 to predict similar climate-related natural hazards such as floods and droughts
 has been demonstrated to be viable and in continous improvement

\begin_layout Section
Aim and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this project is to develop a probabilistic forecasting index
 to predict, on a seasonal basis, bushfire potential.
 This index will be based on climate variables associated with bushfire
 weather and its relationship with climate modes of variability such as
 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
 Even though bushfire occurence is the result of physical, biological and
 human factors, the scope of this endeavor will only take into account bushfire
 weather.
 Additionally, because of its particular proneness and vulnerability to
 bushfires the project will have as a geographical limit the state of Victoria,
 Australia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Significance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research is important becuase it will empower the public, emergency
 response institutions, and policy makers.
 A forecasting scheme able to predict, even with a moderate skill, dangerous
 bushfire seasons will give the opotunity for people to decide for themselves
 with months in advance if the risk is acceptable and to take actions accordingl
y.
 Emergency response institutions, especially those associated with fire
 fighting, will have the knowledge to enhance the efficiency of resource
 allocation.
 This translates directly in economic value, and most importantly, it could
 potentially save lives.
 The forecasting index proposed also aims to support long term policy decisions,
 specifically those regarding the reduction of vulnerability to bushfire
 impacts.

\begin_layout Section
Structure of the thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thesis is organized in six chapters and, without considering the introductio
n which has already been developed, each chapter will be briefly described
 in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapert two describes the behaviour of bushfire weather in Victoria and
 the climate modes of variability which have the greatest influence over
 bushfire potential in this region.
 Understanding bushfire weather is the stepping stone of this project.
 Any attempt on developing a forecasting scheme will rely on a deep command
 on how climate variables associated with bushfires behave.
 To achieve this, a critical review of the literature related to the synoptics
 and dynamics of bushfire weather in Victoria will be presented.
 This review also includes an analysis of the Australian climate drivers
 and their contribution to bushfire occurences in Victoria.
 These drivers are, among the most important, El Nino Southern Oscillation
 (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).
 Additionally, I will present my results regarding the relationship between
 bushfire weather and heatwaves in Victoria, which aim contribute to the
 existing literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter three examines the most commonly used bushfire indices in Australia
 and explores seasonal forecasting schemes in the world.
 This chapter is important since the construction of this new forecasting
 tool is based on the current state of the art- although not constrained
 to it-.
 Therefore, the logic behind the design of indices such as the McArthur
 Forest Fire Danger index (FFDI) and the Fire Weather Index (FWI) of the
 Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System will be evaluated.
 Additionally, the calculated bushfire potential for the 20th century in
 Victoria will be examined from the literature; review that will be complemented
 with my results of seasonal bushfire potential history in this region using
 the FFDI, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) as the source of
 climate data.
 Finally, this chapter will include a critical review of the literature
 related to seasonal forecasting with an especial emphasis in the statistical
 methologies traditionally employed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter four presents the proposal of a seasonal bushfire forecasting tool
 for Victoria: The Victorian Seasonal Bushfire Index (VSBI).
 The sources of data and the metholodology are fully described.
 The results are presented in terms of its forecasting skill, and its relationsh
ip with adapted seasonal metrics of the FFDI.
 Finally, a discussion of the limitations and implications of the new index
 is also presented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter five explores bushfire danger projections for Victoria.
 Regional assessments from the current literature regarding bushfire potential
 in Victoria are reviewed in this chapter.
 Subsequently, my results of future seasonal bushfire potential calculated
 through the VSBI using climate outputs from the Climate Model Intercomparison
 Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are presented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, chapter six will present the conclusions of this thesis, recommedations
 for future work, and some final remarks.
