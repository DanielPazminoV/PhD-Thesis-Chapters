\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The introduction chapter explained the aims, significance and scope of this
 research project.
 It also provided a general context for the study.
 The purpose of this chapter is to expand on the context setting.
 Therefore, it presents a detailed characterization of the study regions:
 Victoria, Australia and Ecuador.
 Additionally, it also explains some of the most important concepts used
 throughout the thesis.
 Explaining them is important because it provides background for the next
 chapters, in particular for the literature review.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three concepts are essential for this thesis.
 These are fire weather, climate modes of variability and seasonal forecasting.
 Fire weather is the main topic of this thesis.
 This chapter examines its main variables, modeling approaches and relationship
 with associated events like heatwaves.
 Drivers of fire weather are large-scale phenomena known as climate modes
 of variability.
 The background describes three climate modes, which are the most relevant
 for this project.
 These are the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and
 the Southern Annular Mode.
 Finally, it provides a brief introduction to seasonal weather forecasting
 techniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the characterization of the study regions focuses on
 three aspects.
 The geography, climate and fire history of Victoria and Ecuador.
 The geography characterization describes the significant landscape features
 of both areas.
 The climate description explains the major drivers, classification of climatic
 regions and climatologies.
 The fire section describes the causes and impacts of bushfires with historical
 cases.

\begin_layout Section
Definition of concepts

\begin_layout Subsection
Fire weather
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary focus of this investigation is fire weather.
 Therefore, this section will introduce some important ideas to understand
 this topic.
 The fire weather background comprises three aspects.
 First, it explains which meteorological variables contribute to fire conditions.
 Additionally, it explains how they exert their influence.
 This section also describes how mathematical models represent the effect
 of fire weather variables on bushfires.
 It includes a description of the Australian Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)
 to explain the quantification of fire danger based on weather parameters.
 Finally, the relationship between fire weather and heatwaves is also described.

Fire weather variables 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire weather is analyzed through variables such as wind, precipitation,
 air temperature, and relative humidity.
 The behaviour of this meteorological variables influences every aspect
 of bushfires, including their ignition, spread and intensity.
 Bushfires start if high temperatures, low levels of relative humidity and
 precipitation have dried vegetation to a flammable point.
 Winds also contribute in the ignition of bushfires by taking moisture content
 out of the vegetation and providing oxygen for combustion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, atmospheric instability favours the occurence of thunderstorms;
 which are a natural ignition source of bushfires 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 The spread of bushfires is controlled by winds, which propagate them and
 also can change their flank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 Atmospheric instability also contributes to the spread of these events
 because it produces spotting—spotfires—.
 The intensity of bushfires is determined by the flammability and distribution
 of vegetation; which are controlled by precipitation on seasonal time scales
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of fire weather variables on bushfires has been described in
 several mathematical models.
 These models represent the ignition, spread or intensity of bushfires.
 Modelling efforts focus on one of these aspects or a combination of them.
 For example, the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McArthur1966,McArthur1967"

\end_inset

 quantifies danger focusing on the effect of weather on vegetation.
 Therefore, this index targets ignition.
 On the other hand, the the Haines Index basis is the effect of atmospheric
 instability in producing spotting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Haines"

\end_inset

.
 This index focuses on spread and intensity.
 The Canadian Forest Fire Weather System 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "VanWagner1974"

\end_inset

 models the three aspects.
 In most cases, fire weather modelling efforts require a calibration process.
 The calibrations account for local conditions such as the type of vegetation
 and topography.
 This investigation uses the FFDI to explore fire weather in the Southern
 Hemisphere because of its calibration criteria.

Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Australian fire authorities use the FFDI for bushfire risk management 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The index was originally formulated by Alan Grant McArthur 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McArthur1966,McArthur1967"

\end_inset

.
 Initially, operators used mechanical meters to calculate the index 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Luke1978"

\end_inset

.
 A set of carboard wheels comprised these devices.
 The meters facilitated the introduction—dialling—of weather data to calculated
 the index.
 The FFDI was later formulated as equations by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Noble1980"

\end_inset

.
 The equation that represents the index is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 This variable usually peaks in the afternoon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The index also requires the computation of a drought factor.
 This factor represents the effect of precipitation on fueld loads drying.

 This contribution corresponds to an improved formula originally proposed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

.
 The DF ranges from 1 to 10.
 These values depend on the number of days of the last

 The identification of this day requires the analysis of the last 20 consecutive
 days.
 The sum of the whole range is assigned to the day of the highest rain.
 This value accounts for the

 The index used an eight inches layer of soil for evaluation, yielding a
 scale that ranges from 0 to 800.
 A zero value represents saturation.
 Daily rainfall and maximum temperature are fundamental variables for the
 calculation of this index.
 Additionally, its calculation is only possible for areas where the mean

Heatwaves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no universal definition for heatwaves 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nairn2013,Perkins2012"

\end_inset

.
 Most definitions characterize them as consecutive days with abnormally
 high temperatures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nairn2013"

\end_inset

.
 More technical definitions adopt thresholds or percentiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 For example, the use an arbitrary number consecutive days that a fixed
 temperature value—also arbitrary—is exceeded 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nairn2013,Perkins2012"

\end_inset

.
 However, is difficult to make comparisons among the proposed definitions
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 Although, maximum temperature is not the only temperature variable used.
 Setting thresholds that include minimum temperature is also common 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Perkins2012,Pezza2011"

\end_inset

.
 This variable accounts for the dissipation of heat at night after a hot
 day.
 Temperature is an important variable of heatwaves as well as of fire weather.
 For this reason, heatwaves are usually linked with increased bushfire risk
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nairn2013,Perkins2012,Pezza2011"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, is important to understand heatwaves behaviour and its relationship
 with fire weather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Australia, heatwaves occur because of three processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McBride2009"

\end_inset

.
 First, the advection of hot and dry air.
 An anticyclone advects air from the north desserts to the forested areas
 in southern Australia.
 Secondly, the subsidence of air that brings atmospheric stability.
 This process produces clear skies that increase solar radiation.
 Finally, the increased insolation generates surface heat fluxes.
 These fluxes heat the air in the mixing layer.
 Fire weather comprises these processes as well.
 Although, its analysis involves more variables and interactions (see subsection

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Climate modes of variability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large-scale meteorological and oceanographic phenomena drive natural climate
 variability.
 These drivers are known as climate modes of variability.
 For example, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD),
 and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are important climate modes of variability
 in the Southern Hemisphere

\begin_layout Standard
The normal state of the Tropical Pacific Ocean is relatively cool waters
 in the east and warm conditions to the west.
 Convection usually takes place in the west, which generates easterly winds
 near to the surface of the ocean.
 The hot and moist air mass originated in the west travel with a westely
 direction in the upper troposphere.
 Along the way it loses heat and moisture.
 Cool and dry air sinks in the east side of the ocean reinforcing the circulatio

 This circulation parttern is known as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weekening of the easterlies reduces the upwelling in the eastern part
 of the Tropical Pacific Ocean.
 This produces an increase in the sea surface temperature, which transfers
 heat to the atmosphere weakinning the Walker circulation and in extreme

However, the mechanisms that drive IOD and ENSO events are similar.
 The IOD process starts with the cooling of SST in Sumatra.
 A wekenning—or even reversal—of the westerly winds close to sea surface
 enhances the SST warming in the west side of the Indian Ocean basin.
 The warm SST produce convection, which drives precipitation over eastern
 Africa.
 The hot and moist air produced by the convection process travel on a westerly
 direction.
 On the upper troposphere the air mass dries and cools, and then sinks over
 Sumatra.
 The subsidence of these air masses produce drought conditions over Indonesia.
 The entire process starts in May and peaks in October

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main source of interannual climate
 variability in the Southern Hemisphere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 This refers to the zonally symetric circulation around Antartica.
 The SAM produces an alternating pattern of strong and weak westerly winds
 in this region.
 This winds are cold and wet and surround Antartica as a belt.
 The SAM drives the expansion and contraction of the circulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This phenomena is caused by the non-uniform heating of the Earth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KingandTurner2007"

\end_inset

.
 This heating regulates heat and mass transport that creates zones of high
 and low pressure in the planet.
 The intensity of the pressure gradient between midlatitudes and latitudes
 close to the South Pole drives the SAM.
 Anomalously high pressures in midlatitudes and low pressures close to the
 poles strenghten the circumpolar vortex.
 The strengthenning process shifts the circulation close to the pole.
 This contraction of the circulation belt produces below-average precipitation
 in many regions of the Southern Hemisphere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This process refers to a positive SAM event (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Positive-phase-of-Southern-Annular-Mode"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, when the pressure anomalies show the opposite pattern
 the circumpolar vortex is weakened and the circulation is shifted away
 from the South Pole.
 The effect of precipitation over the same regions is the opposite.
 This produces a negative SAM event.

The Great Dividing Range (GDR), has created three main climatic zones: northern,
 southern and southeastern Victoria 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Luke1978"

\end_inset

.
 In northern Victoria, precipitation is influenced by northwesterly air
 masses.
 The north-west region of this climatic zone receives an annual average
 of 250 to 300 mm of precipitation and endures intense heatwaves; whereas,
 in the north-east the precense of mountains raises the precipitation range
 to 800-1000 mm in a year.
 Precipitation in southern Victoria also increases with altitude; however,
 westerly winds drive its formation.
 In contrast, variations in temperature in this zone are driven by northerly
 winds, which produce summers with average air temperature of 28

 In southeastern Victoria, synoptic systems in the Tasman Sea influence
 its precipitation rate, especially in the eastern region that recieves
 on average 1000 mm a year.
 The western region of southeastern Victoria is less influenced by the Tasman
 Sea, receiving on average 600 mm of precipitation.

Since most bushfires in Ecuador occur in the highlands, the climate characteriza
tion focuses on this region.
 The Amazon forest, oceanic currents, and the topography are among the main
 climate drivers in the Tropical Andes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 The Amazon forests produce a great amount of water vapor.
 Topography forces this water to precipitate in the western Cordillera.
 Orographic precipitation also occurs in the eastern Cordillera.
 Air masses advected from the Pacific Ocean bring moisture to this flank
 of the Andes.
 The influence of the Pacific Ocean in the Tropical Andes climate variability
 is important.
 The inter-annual variability on this region depends on ENSO

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter comprised two parts.
 First, it explained important concepts for the argument of the thesis.
 Additionally, it also characterized the study regions for this research:
 Victoria, Australia and Ecuador.
 This summary highlights the most important aspects of both sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three concepts are essential for this thesis.
 The first concept is fire weather.
 It refers to the meteorological conditions that foster bushfire occurrences.
 The main fire weather variables are temperature, relative humidity, wind
 speed and precipitation.
 These variables can be combined in mathematical equations to evaluate fire
 danger.
 The second concept is climate modes of variability.
 These are large-scale meteorological and oceanographic phenomena.
 They can influence local climate from remote places.
 The Southern Hemisphere has three important climate modes of variability.
 These are the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole
 (IOD), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).
 Finally, a sub-section explained seasonal weather forecasting.
 It refers to the use of weather variables to predict weather behaviour
 in lead times of months.
 Statistical and dynamical models are used in seasonal weather forecasting.
 This chapter also characterized the study regions of this research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characterization featured several links between Victoria and Ecuador.
 First of all, vegetation is their landscape connection.
 They share the Eucalyptus as the dominant species in bushfire-prone areas.
 The two regions also share ENSO as a climate driver.
 In fact, ENSO is the main climate driver for Ecuador.
 However, Victoria's climate is more complex.
 Interactions between ENSO, the IOD, and the SAM strongly influence its
 climate Finally, Ecuador lacks comprehensive fire history documentation.
 However, data obtained from recent years suggests that bushfire impacts
 in Ecuador are severe.
 This hazard endangers one of the most biodiverse countries in the world.
 On the other hand, Victoria's fire history is better documented.
 It has endured catastrophic bushfire events over the last 100 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of essential concepts and the characterization of the study
 regions was a necessary step.
 This information provides background to analyse critically the relevant
 scientific literature.
 The next chapter presents the literature review for this project.
