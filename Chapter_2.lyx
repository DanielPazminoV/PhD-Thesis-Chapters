Meterological variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bushfire weather is analyzed through variables such as wind, precipitation,
 air temperature, and relative humidity.
 The behaviour of this meteorological variables influences every aspect
 of bushfires, including their start, spread and intensity.
 Bushfires start if high temperatures, low levels of relative humidity and
 precipitation have dried vegetation to a flammable point.
 Winds also contribute in the ignition of bushfires by taking moisture content
 out of the vegetation and providing oxygen for combustion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bradstock2012"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, atmospheric instability favours the occurence of thunderstorms;
 which are a natural ignition source of bushfires 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 The spread of bushfires is controlled by winds, which propagate them and
 also can change their flank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BureauofMeteorology2008"

\end_inset

.
 Atmospheric instability also contributes to the spread of these events
 because it produces spotting (spotfires).
 The intensity of bushfires is determined by the flammability and distribution
 of vegetation; which are controlled by precipitation in seasonal time scales

, based on the work of Alan Grant McArthur
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The index is represented as an equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Drought Factor (DF) equation and calculation procedures were developed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Griffiths1999"

\end_inset

, which corresponds to an improved formula originally proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Noble1980"

\end_inset

.
 The DF ranges form 1 to 10 and the value depends on the number of days
 of the last significant rain and soil dryness.
 According to the author, the procedure to identify the last significant
 rain consists in analyzing 20 consecutive days and assigning to the day
 of the highest rain the sum of the rain of the whole range.
 The soil dryness represents the amount of rain necessary to saturate the
 upper 200 mm of soil layer, and is determined as an index usually calculated
 by the methodologies proposed by

 for the U.S Department of Agriculture-Forest Service, which originally used
 an 8 inches (approximately 200 mm) layer of soil for evaluation, yielding
 an index that ranges from 0 to 800.
 A zero value represents saturation and eight hundred is the highest possible
 value of dryness for a soil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental variables for the calculation of this index are rainfall
 and maximum temperature.
 The index can only be calculated for areas where the mean annual rainfall
 is known; additionally, the information of the 24 hours past rainfall is
 a fundamental requirement for the computation.
 Temperature is a key factor of evapotranspiration that is incorporated
 in the physical theory of soil moisture depletion used for the elaboration
 of the index.

El Niño-Southern Oscillation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
El Niño Southern Oscillation is a physical process in which the Tropical
 Pacifc Ocean interacts with the atmosphere.
 This is a large-scale process that drives climate on a global scale.
 The most common manifestation of this process is the warming and cooling
 of sea surface temperature in the Tropical Pacific Ocean.
 Warming conditions represent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

El Niño
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conditions.
 This conditions usually bring above-average precipitation in th coasts
 of Ecuador and Peru, while bringing hot and dry conditions in the other
 side of the Pacific Ocean (e.g.
 Indonesia, Australia).
 Cooling conditions represent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

La Niña
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conditions.
 The phenomena is referred as oscillation since these two conditions alternate
 in periods of approximately four years.
 These changing conditions in the sea surface temperature reverse the Walker
 circulation.
 This change in the circulation pattern drives the atmospheric response,
 which can have an effect in places distant where it started.
 For example, the change in sea surface temeprature anomalies in the east
 Tropical Pacific can affectclimate in Indonesia and Australia.
 This type of response is referred as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

teleconnection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal state of the Tropical Pacific Ocean is relatively cool waters
 in the east and warm conditions to the west.
 Convection usually takes place in the west, which generates easterly winds
 near to the surface of the ocean.
 The hot and moist air mass originated in the west travel with a westely
 direction in the upper troposphere.
 Along the way they lose heat and moisturte.
 Cool and dry air sinks in the east side of the ocean reinforcing the circulatio
n pattern.
 This circulation parttern is known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Walker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 circulation, name coined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bjerknes1969"

\end_inset

 in honour to Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker.
 A weekening of the easterlies reduces the upwelling in the eastern part
 of the Tropical Pacific Ocean.
 This produces an increase in the sea surface temperature, which transfers
 heat to the atmosphere weakinning the Walker circulation and in extreme
 cases reversing it.
 These changes in sea surface temperature produced by the changes in wind
 stress over the ocean are called an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

El Niño
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event.
 At the same time, the changes in the circulation of air masses produced
 by the heat flux (changes in sea surface temperatures) produce variations
 in surface pressures along the Tropcial Pacific.
 This is the main manifestation of a larger phenomena called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Southern Oscillation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For this reason this phenomena is regarded as coupled ocean-atmophere process.
 The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

El Niño-Southern Oscillation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aims to reflect this complexity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common ENSO metric is the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
 The SOI represents the difference in normalized surface pressure between
 Taihiti and Darwin, Australia.
 We adopted the SOI’s calculation method proposed by the National Oceanic
 and Atmospheric Administration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NOAA"

\end_inset

.
 The index reflects the changes in air-mass fluxes in the tropical Pacific
 Ocean.
 These fluxes, are a manifestation of changes in sea surface temperature
 (SST).
 The SOI has an open ended scale with positive and negative values.
 A negative SOI value represents above-average warm SST conditions in the
 eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
 This represents an ’El Niño’ phase of the phenomenon.
 El Niño brings wet conditions to the coasts of southern Ecuador and northern
 Peru.
 The opposite pattern occurs with a positive SOI value, representing a ’La
 Niña’ phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another ENSO index is the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The ONI measures monthly SST values in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Indian Ocean Dipole
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is another coupled ocean-atmosphere physical
 process.
 This process is characterized by cool sea surface temperatures in Sumatra
 and warmer than average SST in the western side of the Indian Ocean basin—posit
ive IOD—(see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Positive-phase-of-Indian-Ocean-Dipole"

\end_inset

).
 This dipole structure explains 12% of the variance in sea suface temperature
 in this region.
 This is a process independent of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, although
 this is a matter of ongoing debate.

\begin_layout Standard
However, the mechanisms that drive both events are similar.
 The IOD process starts with the cooling of SST in Sumatra.
 A wekenning—or even reversal—of the westerly winds close to sea surface
 enhances the SST warming in the west side of the Indian Ocean basin.
 The warm SST produce convection, which drives precipitation over eastern
 Africa.
 The hot and moist air produce by the convection process travel on a westerly
 direction.
 On the upper troposphere the air mass dries and cools, and then sinks over
 Sumatra.
 The subsidence of these air masses produce drought conditions over Indonesia.
 The entire process starts in May and peaks in October.

\begin_layout Subsection
Southern Annular Mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main source of interannual climate
 variability in the Southern Hemisphere.
 This refers to the zonally symetric—annular—structure of circulation around
 Antartica.
 The SAM produces an alternating pattern of strong and weak westerly winds
 in this region.
 This winds are cold and wet and surround Antartica as a belt.
 The SAM drives the expansion and contraction of this belt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This phenomena is caused by the non-uniform heating of the Earth.
 This heating regulates heat and mass transport that creates zones of high
 and low pressure in the planet.
 The intensity of the pressure gradient between midlatitudes and latitudes
 close to the South Pole drives the SAM.
 Anomalously high pressures in midlatitudes and low pressures close to the
 poles strenghten the circumpolar vortex.
 The strengthenning process shifts the circulation close to the pole.
 .
 This contraction of the belt produces below-average precipitation in many
 regions of the Southern Hemisphre.
 This is a positive SAM event (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Positive-phase-of-Southern-Annular-Mode"

\end_inset

).
 On the otherm hand, when the presure anomalies show the opposite pattern
 the circumpolar vortex is weakened and the circulation is shifted away
 from the South Pole.
 The effect of precipitation over the same regions is the opposite.
 This produces a negative SAM event.

 This mountain range crosses Ecuador from North to South.
 The Ecuadorian Andes comprises two flanks of mountains: the eastern and
 western ’Cordilleras’.
 Between these two flanks—that include active volcanoes—there are several
 inter-Andean valleys.
 Many of these Andean plateaus are over 3000 m above sea level.
 The steep elevations have an important effect on local climate.
 The lapse rate create the conditions for different Bio-climatic zones to
 exit.
 This enhances biodiversity.
 Yet, the original vegetation of the Andean valleys has almost disappeared.
 Most of the endemic vegetation was replaced by the Australian specie Eucalyptus

The Great Dividing Range (GDR), has created three main climatic zones: northern,
 southern and southeastern Victoria.
 In northern Victoria, precipitation is influenced by northwesterly air
 masses.
 The north-west region of this climatic zone receives an annual average
 of 250 to 300 mm of precipitation and endures intense heatwaves; whereas,
 in the north-east the precense of mountains raises the precitation range
 to 800-1000 mm in a year.
 Precipitation in southern Victoria also increases with altitude; however,
 westerly winds drive its formation.
 In contrast, variations in temperature in this zone are driven by northerly
 winds, which produce summers with average air temperature of 28 ºC and
 maxima of 43 ºC.
 In southeastern Victoria, synoptic systems in the Tasman Sea influence
 its precipitation rate, especially in the eastern region that recieves
 in average 1000 mm in a year.
 The western region of southeastern Victoria is less influenced by the Tasman
 Sea, and receives in average 600 mm of precipitation.

 drivers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The Amazon forest—through Evapo-transpiration—produces a great amount of
 water vapor.
 This water precipitates along the western Cordillera because of an orographic
 precipitation process.
 This precipitation is also produced in the eastern Cordillera.
 Air masses advected from the Pacific Ocean produce this effect.
 The influence of the Pacific Ocean in the climate variability is important.
 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is the main driver of decadal climate
 variability in this region
